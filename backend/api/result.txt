(1) Any person who has duly filed, in or for

(a) any State party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property or

(b) any Member of the World Trade Organization,

an application for a patent, a utility model or a utility certificate, or his successor in title, shall enjoy, for the purpose of filing a European patent application in respect of the same invention, a right of priority during a period of twelve months from the date of filing of the first application.

(2) Every filing that is equivalent to a regular national filing under the national law of the State where it was made or under bilateral or multilateral agreements, including this Convention, shall be recognised as giving rise to a right of priority.

(3) A regular national filing shall mean any filing that is sufficient to establish the date on which the application was filed, whatever the outcome of the application may be.

(4) A subsequent application in respect of the same subject-matter as a previous first application and filed in or for the same State shall be considered as the first application for the purposes of determining priority, provided that, at the date of filing the subsequent application, the previous application has been withdrawn, abandoned or refused, without being open to public inspection and without leaving any rights outstanding, and has not served as a basis for claiming a right of priority. The previous application may not thereafter serve as a basis for claiming a right of priority.

(5) If the first filing has been made with an industrial property authority which is not subject to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property or the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply if that authority, according to a communication issued by the President of the European Patent Office, recognises that a first filing made with the European Patent Office gives rise to a right of priority under conditions and with effects equivalent to those laid down in the Paris Convention.

(2) Multiple priorities may be claimed in respect of a European patent application, notwithstanding the fact that they originated in different countries. Where appropriate, multiple priorities may be claimed for any one claim. Where multiple priorities are claimed, time limits which run from the date of priority shall run from the earliest date of priority.

(3) If one or more priorities are claimed in respect of a European patent application, the right of priority shall cover only those elements of the European patent application which are included in the application or applications whose priority is claimed.

(4) If certain elements of the invention for which priority is claimed do not appear among the claims formulated in the previous application, priority may nonetheless be granted, provided that the documents of the previous application as a whole specifically disclose such elements.

Directive 98/44/EC of 6 July 199840 on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions shall be used as a supplementary means of interpretation.

(2) "Biotechnological inventions" are inventions which concern a product consisting of or containing biological material or a process by means of which biological material is produced, processed or used.

(3) "Biological material" means any material containing genetic information and capable of reproducing itself or being reproduced in a biological system.

(4) "Plant variety" means any plant grouping within a single botanical taxon of the lowest known rank, which grouping, irrespective of whether the conditions for the grant of a plant variety right are fully met, can be:

(a) defined by the expression of the characteristics that results from a given genotype or combination of genotypes,

(b) distinguished from any other plant grouping by the expression of at least one of the said characteristics, and

(c) considered as a unit with regard to its suitability for being propagated unchanged.

(5) A process for the production of plants or animals is essentially biological if it consists entirely of natural phenomena such as crossing or selection.

(6) "Microbiological process" means any process involving or performed upon or resulting in microbiological material.

(1) Biological material deposited in accordance with Rule 31 shall be available upon request to any person from the date of publication of the European patent application and to any person having the right to inspect the files under Article 128, paragraph 2, prior to that date. Subject to Rule 32, such availability shall be effected by the issue of a sample of the biological material to the person making the request (hereinafter referred to as "the requester").

(2) Said issue shall be made only if the requester has undertaken vis-à-vis the applicant for or proprietor of the patent not to make the biological material or any biological material derived therefrom available to any third party and to use that material for experimental purposes only, until such time as the patent application is refused or withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn, or before the European patent has expired in all the designated States, unless the applicant for or proprietor of the patent expressly waives such an undertaking.

The undertaking to use the biological material for experimental purposes only shall not apply in so far as the requester is using that material under a compulsory licence. The term "compulsory licence" shall be construed as including ex officio licences and the right to use patented inventions in the public interest.

(3) For the purposes of paragraph 2, derived biological material shall mean any material which still exhibits those characteristics of the deposited material which are essential to carrying out the invention. The undertaking under paragraph 2 shall not impede any deposit of derived biological material necessary for the purpose of patent procedure.

(4) The request referred to in paragraph 1 shall be submitted to the European Patent Office on a form recognised by that Office. The European Patent Office shall certify on the form that a European patent application referring to the deposit of the biological material has been filed, and that the requester or the expert nominated by him under Rule 32 is entitled to the issue of a sample of that material. After grant of the European patent, the request shall also be submitted to the European Patent Office.

(5) The European Patent Office shall transmit a copy of the request, with the certification provided for in paragraph 4, to the depositary institution and to the applicant for or the proprietor of the patent.

(6)52 The European Patent Office shall publish in its Official Journal the list of depositary institutions recognised for the purpose of Rules 31, 33 and Rule 34.

EPC EPC 1973 R. 42 R. 27Rule 43 Form and content of claims

(1) The claims shall define the matter for which protection is sought in terms of the technical features of the invention. Wherever appropriate, claims shall contain:

(a) a statement indicating the designation of the subject-matter of the invention and those technical features which are necessary for the definition of the claimed subject-matter but which, in combination, form part of the prior art;

(b) a characterising portion, beginning with the expression "characterised in that" or "characterised by" and specifying the technical features for which, in combination with the features stated under sub-paragraph (a), protection is sought.

(2) Without prejudice to Article 82, a European patent application may contain more than one independent claim in the same category (product, process, apparatus or use) only if the subject-matter of the application involves one of the following:

(a) a plurality of interrelated products,

(b) different uses of a product or apparatus,

(c) alternative solutions to a particular problem, where it is inappropriate to cover these alternatives by a single claim.

(3) Any claim stating the essential features of an invention may be followed by one or more claims concerning particular embodiments of that invention.

(4) Any claim which includes all the features of any other claim (dependent claim) shall contain, if possible at the beginning, a reference to the other claim and then state the additional features. A dependent claim directly referring to another dependent claim shall also be admissible. All dependent claims referring back to a single previous claim, and all dependent claims referring back to several previous claims, shall be grouped together to the extent and in the most appropriate way possible.

(5) The number of claims shall be reasonable with regard to the nature of the invention claimed. The claims shall be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals.

(6) Except where absolutely necessary, claims shall not rely on references to the description or drawings in specifying the technical features of the invention. In particular, they shall not contain such expressions as "as described in part ... of the description", or "as illustrated in figure ... of the drawings".

(7) Where the European patent application contains drawings including reference signs, the technical features specified in the claims shall preferably be followed by such reference signs relating to these features, placed in parentheses, if the intelligibility of the claim can thereby be increased. These reference signs shall not be construed as limiting the claim.

(2) Drawings shall be executed as follows:

(a) Drawings shall be executed without colourings in durable, black, sufficiently dense and dark, uniformly thick and well-defined lines and strokes.

(b) Cross-sections shall be indicated by hatching which should not impede the clear reading of the reference signs and leading lines.

(c) The scale of the drawings and their graphical execution shall be such that electronic or photographic reproduction with a linear reduction in size to two-thirds will allow all details to be distinguished without difficulty. If, exceptionally, the scale is given on a drawing, it shall be represented graphically.

(d) All numbers, letters, and reference signs appearing on the drawings shall be simple and clear. Brackets, circles or inverted commas shall not be used in association with numbers and letters.

(e) Generally, all lines in the drawings shall be drawn with the aid of drafting instruments.

(f) Elements of the same figure shall be proportional to one another, unless a difference in proportion is indispensable for the clarity of the figure.

(g) The height of the numbers and letters shall not be less than 0.32 cm. For the lettering of drawings, the Latin and, where customary, the Greek alphabets shall be used.

(h) The same sheet of drawings may contain several figures. Where figures drawn on two or more sheets are intended to form a single figure, the figures on the several sheets shall be so arranged that the whole figure can be assembled without concealing any part of the partial figures. The different figures shall be arranged without wasting space, preferably in an upright position, clearly separated from one another. Where the figures are not arranged in an upright position, they shall be presented sideways with the top of the figures at the left side of the sheet. The different figures shall be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals, independently of the numbering of the sheets.

(i) Reference signs not mentioned in the description and claims shall not appear in the drawings, and vice versa. Reference signs to features shall be consistent throughout the application.

(j) The drawings shall not contain text matter. Where indispensable to understand the drawings, a few short keywords, such as "water", "steam", "open", "closed" or "section on AB", may be included. Any such keywords shall be placed in such a way that, if required, they can be replaced by their translations without interfering with any lines of the drawings.

(3) Flow sheets and diagrams shall be deemed to be drawings.

(3)82 Where the previous application is not in an official language of the European Patent Office and the validity of the priority claim is relevant to the determination of the patentability of the invention concerned, the European Patent Office shall invite the applicant for or proprietor of the European patent to file a translation of that application into one of the official languages within a period to be specified. Alternatively, a declaration may be submitted that the European patent application is a complete translation of the previous application. Paragraph 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis. If a requested translation of a previous application is not filed in due time, the right of priority for the European patent application or for the European patent with respect to that application shall be lost. The applicant for or proprietor of the European patent shall be informed accordingly.

(1) Proceedings before the European Patent Office shall be interrupted:

(a) in the event of the death or legal incapacity of the applicant for or proprietor of a European patent or of the person authorised by national law to act on his behalf. To the extent that the above events do not affect the authorisation of a representative appointed under Article 134, proceedings shall be interrupted only on application by such representative;

(b) in the event of the applicant for or proprietor of a patent, as a result of some action taken against his property, being prevented by legal reasons from continuing the proceedings;

(c) in the event of the death or legal incapacity of the representative of an applicant for or proprietor of a patent, or of his being prevented for legal reasons resulting from action taken against his property from continuing the proceedings.

(2)173 When, in the cases referred to in paragraph 1(a) or (b)paragraph 1, the European Patent Office has been informed of the identity of the person authorised to continue the proceedings, it shall notify such person and, where applicable, any third party, that the proceedings will be resumed as from a specified date. If, three years after the publication of the date of interruption in the European Patent Bulletin, the European Patent Office has not been informed of the identity of the person authorised to continue the proceedings, it may set a date on which it intends to resume the proceedings of its own motion.

(3) In the case referred to in paragraph 1(c), the proceedings shall be resumed when the European Patent Office has been informed of the appointment of a new representative of the applicant or when the Office has informed the other parties of the appointment of a new representative of the proprietor of the patent. If, three months after the beginning of the interruption of the proceedings, the European Patent Office has not been informed of the appointment of a new representative, it shall communicate to the applicant for or proprietor of the patent:

(a) where Article 133, paragraph 2, is applicable, that the European patent application will be deemed to be withdrawn or the European patent will be revoked if the information is not submitted within two months of this communication; or

(b) otherwise, that the proceedings will be resumed with the applicant for or proprietor of the patent as from the notification of this communication.

(4) Any periods, other than those for requesting examination and paying renewal fees, in force at the date of interruption of the proceedings, shall begin again as from the day on which the proceedings are resumed. If such date is less than two months before the end of the period within which the request for examination must be filed, such a request may be filed within two months of such date.

That authority shall transmit the letters rogatory either to the competent court or authority in that State, or to the European Patent Office where no court or authority is competent in that State.

(5) The European Patent Office shall be informed of the time when, and the place where, the enquiry or other legal measure is to take place and shall inform the parties, witnesses and experts concerned.

(6) If so requested by the European Patent Office, the competent court or authority shall permit the attendance of members of the department concerned and allow them to question any person giving evidence either directly or through the competent court or authority.

When seeking such consent, the competent court or authority shall indicate the approximate costs which would result from this procedure. If the European Patent Office gives its consent, the Organisation shall reimburse any costs incurred; otherwise, the Organisation shall not be liable for such costs.

CA/D 17/07 (OJ EPO 2007, 533)Article 6 Particulars concerning payments

(1) Every payment must indicate the name of the person making the payment and must contain the necessary particulars to enable the Office to establish immediately the purpose of the payment.

(2) If the purpose of the payment cannot immediately be established, the Office shall require the person making the payment to notify it in writing of this purpose within such period as it may specify. If he does not comply with this request in due time the payment shall be considered not to have been made.Article 7 Date to be considered as the date on which payment is made

(1) The date on which any payment shall be considered to have been made to the Office shall be the date on which the amount of the payment or of the transfer is actually entered in a bank account held by the Office.

(2) Where the President of the Office allows, in accordance with the provisions of Article 5, paragraph 2 RFees, other methods of paying fees than those set out in Article 5, paragraph 1 RFees, he shall also lay down the date on which such payments shall be considered to have been made.

(3) Where, under the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, payment of a fee is not considered to have been made until after the expiry of the period in which it should have been made, it shall be considered that this period has been observed if evidence is provided to the Office that the person who made the payment fulfilled one of the following conditions in a Contracting State within the period within which the payment should have been made:

(i) he effected the payment through a banking establishment;

(ii) he duly gave an order to a banking establishment to transfer the amount of the payment.

(4) The Office may request the person who made the payment to produce evidence as to the date on which a condition according to paragraph 3 was fulfilled within a period to be specified by it. If he fails to comply with this request or if the evidence is insufficient, the period for payment shall be considered not to have been observed.

A time limit for payment shall in principle be deemed to have been observed only if the full amount of the fee has been paid in due time. If the fee is not paid in full, the amount which has been paid shall be refunded after the period for payment has expired. The Office may, however, in so far as this is possible within the time remaining before the end of the period, give the person making the payment the opportunity to pay the amount lacking. It may also, where this is considered justified, overlook any small amounts lacking without prejudice to the rights of the person making the payment.

(3) The rapporteur shall carry out a preliminary study of the appeal and shall, subject to the direction of the Chair of the Board, assess whether the appeal should be given priority over, or should be treated together with, other appeals assigned to the rapporteur.

(4) The rapporteur shall draft communications on behalf of the Board, subject to the direction of the Chair in the particular appeal, and shall make the preparations for meetings of the Board and for oral proceedings.

(5) The rapporteur shall draft decisions.

(6) A rapporteur or additional rapporteur who considers that their knowledge of the language of the proceedings is insufficient for drafting communications or decisions may draft these in one of the other official languages. The drafts shall be translated by the European Patent Office into the language of the proceedings and the translations shall be checked by the rapporteur or by another member of the Board in the particular appeal.

Article 6 Registries

(1) Registries shall be established for the Boards of Appeal. Registrars shall be responsible for the discharge of the functions of the Registries. One of the Registrars shall be designated as head of the Registry.

(2) The Presidium referred to in Rule 12b, paragraph 1 EPC, EPC may entrust to the Registrars the execution of functions which involve no technical or legal difficulties, in particular in relation to arranging for inspection of files, issuing summonses to oral proceedings, notifications and granting requests for further processing of applications.

(3) The Registrar shall report to the Chair of the Board on the admissibility of each newly filed appeal.

(4) The Chair in the particular appeal shall designate a member of the Board or, with the agreement of the Chair of the Board, the Registrar, to draw up the minutes of the oral proceedings and of the taking of evidence.

Article 7 Interpreters

If required, the Chair in the particular appeal shall make arrangements for interpretation during oral proceedings, the taking of evidence or the deliberations of the Board.

Article 8 Change in the composition of a Board

(1) If the composition of a Board is changed after oral proceedings, the parties shall be informed that, at the request of any party, fresh oral proceedings shall be held before the Board in its new composition. Fresh oral proceedings shall also be held if so requested by the new member and if the other members of the Board in the particular appeal have given their agreement.

(2) Each new member shall be bound to the same extent as the other members by an interlocutory decision which has already been taken.

(3) A member who is unable to act after the Board has already reached a decision on the appeal shall not be replaced. If the Chair in a particular appeal is unable to act, the member of the Board having the longer or longest service on the Boards of Appeal or, in the case where members have the same length of service, the elder or eldest member, shall sign the decision on behalf of the Chair.

Article 9 Enlargement of a Board

If a Board consisting of two technically qualified members and one legally qualified member considers that the nature of the appeal requires that the Board should consist of three technically qualified members and two legally qualified members, the decision to enlarge the Board shall be taken at the earliest possible stage in the examination of that appeal.

Article 10 Consolidation and acceleration of appeal proceedings

(1) If several appeals are filed from a decision, these appeals shall be dealt with in the same proceedings.

(2) If appeals are filed from separate decisions but are clearly connected to each other and if they are to be examined by a Board in the same composition, that Board shall endeavour to deal with them one immediately after the other. The Board may, after having heard the parties, also deal with such appeals in consolidated proceedings.

(3) On request by a party, the Board may accelerate the appeal proceedings. The request shall contain reasons justifying the acceleration and shall, where appropriate, be supported by documentary evidence. The Board shall inform the parties whether the request has been granted.

(4) If a court or other competent authority in a Contracting State requests acceleration of the appeal proceedings, the Board shall inform the court or authority and the parties whether the request has been granted and when oral proceedings, if foreseen, are likely to take place.

(5) The Board may accelerate the appeal proceedings of its own motion.

(6) If the Board accelerates the appeal proceedings, it shall give the appeal priority over other appeals. The Board may adopt a strict framework for the proceedings.

Article 11 Remittal

The Board shall not remit a case to the department whose decision was appealed for further prosecution, unless special reasons present themselves for doing so. As a rule, fundamental deficiencies which are apparent in the proceedings before that department constitute such special reasons.

Article 12 Basis of appeal proceedings

(1) Appeal proceedings shall be based on

(a) the decision under appeal and minutes of any oral proceedings before the department having issued that decision;

(b) the notice of appeal and statement of grounds of appeal filed pursuant to Article 108 EPC;

(c) in cases where there is more than one party, any written reply of the other party or parties to be filed within four months of notification of the grounds of appeal;

(d) any communication sent by the Board and any answer thereto filed pursuant to directions of the Board;

(e) minutes of any video or telephone conference with the party or parties sent by the Board.

(2) In view of the primary object of the appeal proceedings to review the decision under appeal in a judicial manner, a partyꞌs appeal case shall be directed to the requests, facts, objections, arguments and evidence on which the decision under appeal was based.

(3) The statement of grounds of appeal and the reply shall contain a party's complete appeal case. Accordingly, they shall set out clearly and concisely the reasons why it is requested that the decision under appeal be reversed, amended or upheld, and should specify expressly all the requests, facts, objections, arguments and evidence relied on. All documents referred to shall be

(a) attached as annexes insofar as they have not already been filed in the course of the grant, opposition or appeal proceedings or produced by the Office in said proceedings;

(b) filed in any event to the extent that the Board so directs in a particular case.

(4) Any part of a party's appeal case which does not meet the requirements in paragraph 2 is to be regarded as an amendment, unless the party demonstrates that this part was admissibly raised and maintained in the proceedings leading to the decision under appeal. Any such amendment may be admitted only at the discretion of the Board.

The party shall clearly identify each amendment and provide reasons for submitting it in the appeal proceedings. In the case of an amendment to a patent application or patent, the party shall also indicate the basis for the amendment in the application as filed and provide reasons why the amendment overcomes the objections raised.

The Board shall exercise its discretion in view of, inter alia, the complexity of the amendment, the suitability of the amendment to address the issues which led to the decision under appeal, and the need for procedural economy.

(5) The Board has discretion not to admit any part of a submission by a party which does not meet the requirements in paragraph 3.

(6) The Board shall not admit requests, facts, objections or evidence which were not admitted in the proceedings leading to the decision under appeal, unless the decision not to admit them suffered from an error in the use of discretion or unless the circumstances of the appeal case justify their admittance.

The Board shall not admit requests, facts, objections or evidence which should have been submitted, or which were no longer maintained, in the proceedings leading to the decision under appeal, unless the circumstances of the appeal case justify their admittance.

(7) Periods specified by the Board may exceptionally be extended at the Board's discretion upon a written and reasoned request, presented before the expiry of such period. The same applies mutatis mutandis to the period referred to in paragraph 1(c); however, this period may only be extended up to a maximum of six months.

(8) Subject to Articles 113 and 116 EPC, the Board may decide the case at any time after filing of the statement of grounds of appeal or, in cases where there is more than one party, after the expiry of the period referred to in paragraph 1(c).

Article 13 Amendment to a party's appeal case

(1) Any amendment to a party's appeal case after it has filed its grounds of appeal or reply is subject to the party's justification for its amendment and may be admitted only at the discretion of the Board.

Article 12, paragraphs 4 to 6, shall apply mutatis mutandis.

The party shall provide reasons for submitting the amendment at this stage of the appeal proceedings.

The Board shall exercise its discretion in view of, inter alia, the current state of the proceedings, the suitability of the amendment to resolve the issues which were admissibly raised by another party in the appeal proceedings or which were raised by the Board, whether the amendment is detrimental to procedural economy, and, in the case of an amendment to a patent application or patent, whether the party has demonstrated that any such amendment, prima facie, overcomes the issues raised by another party in the appeal proceedings or by the Board and does not give rise to new objections.

(2) Any amendment to a party's appeal case made after the expiry of a period specified by the Board in a communication under Rule 100, paragraph 2, EPC or, where such a communication is not issued, after notification of a summons to oral proceedings communication under Article 15, paragraph 1, shall, in principle, not be taken into account unless there are exceptional circumstances, which have been justified with cogent reasons by the party concerned.

(3) Other parties shall be entitled to submit their observations on any amendment not held inadmissible by the Board ex officio.

Article 14 Interventions

Where, during a pending appeal, notice of intervention is filed, Articles 12 and 13 shall apply in so far as justified by the circumstances of the case.

Article 15 Oral proceedings and issuing decisions

(1) 2 Without prejudice to Rule 115, paragraph 1, EPC, the Board shall, if oral proceedings are to take place, endeavour to give at least four months' notice of the summons. In cases where there is more than one party, the Board shall endeavour to issue the summons no earlier than two months after receipt of the written reply or replies referred to in Article 12, paragraph 1(c). A single date is fixed for the oral proceedings.

In order to help concentration on essentials during the oral proceedings, the Board shall issue a communication drawing attention to matters that seem to be of particular significance for the decision to be taken. The Board may also provide a preliminary opinion. The Board shall endeavour to issue the communication at least four months in advance of the date of the oral proceedings. In cases where there is more than one party, the Board shall issue the communication no earlier than one month after receipt of the written reply or replies referred to in Article 12, paragraph 1(c).

(2) A request of a party for a change of the date fixed for oral proceedings may be allowed if the party has put forward serious reasons which justify the fixing of a new date. If the party is represented, the serious reasons must relate to the representative.

(a) The request shall be filed in writing, reasoned and, where appropriate, supported by documentary evidence. The request shall be filed as soon as possible after the summons to oral proceedings has been notified and the serious reasons in question have arisen. The request should include a list of dates on which the requesting party is not available for oral proceedings.

(b) Reasons which may justify a change of the date for oral proceedings include:

(i) notification of a summons to oral proceedings in other proceedings before the European Patent Office or a national court received before notification of the summons to oral proceedings before the Board;

(ii) serious illness;

(iii) a death within the family;

(iv) marriage or formation of a similar recognised partnership;

(v) military service or other obligatory performance of civic duties;

(vi) holidays or business trips which have been firmly booked before notification of the summons to oral proceedings.

(c) Reasons which, as a rule, do not justify a change of the date for oral proceedings include:

(i) filing of new requests, facts, objections, arguments or evidence;

(ii) excessive work pressure;

(iii) unavailability of a duly represented party;

(iv) unavailability of an accompanying person;

(v) appointment of a new professional representative.

(3) The Board shall not be obliged to delay any step in the proceedings, including its decision, by reason only of the absence at the oral proceedings of a party duly summoned who may then be treated as relying only on its written case.

(4) The Chair presides over the oral proceedings and ensures their fair, orderly and efficient conduct.

(5) When a case is ready for decision during oral proceedings, the Chair shall state the final requests of the parties and declare the debate closed. No submissions may be made by the parties after the closure of the debate unless the Board decides to re-open the debate.

(6) The Board shall ensure that each case is ready for decision at the conclusion of the oral proceedings, unless there are special reasons to the contrary. Before the oral proceedings are closed, the decision may be announced orally by the Chair.

(7) Where the decision on the appeal has been announced orally in accordance with paragraph 6, the reasons for the decision, or parts thereof, may, with the explicit consent of the parties, be put in writing in abridged form. However, where it has been indicated to the Board that a third party or a court has, in the particular case, a legitimate interest in the reasons for the decision not being in abridged form, they shall not be abridged. Where appropriate, the reasons for the decision in abridged form may already be included in the minutes of the oral proceedings.

(8) If the Board agrees with the finding of the department which issued the decision under appeal, on one or more issues, and with the reasons given for it in the decision under appeal, the Board may put the reasons for its decision in abridged form in respect of that issue.

(9) The Board shall issue the decision on the appeal in a timely manner.

(a) Where the Chair announces the decision on the appeal orally in accordance with paragraph 6, the Board shall put the decision in writing and despatch it within three months of the date of the oral proceedings. If the Board is unable to do so, it shall inform the parties when the decision is to be despatched. The President of the Boards of Appeal shall also be informed thereof.

(b) When a case is ready for decision at the conclusion of the oral proceedings but the Chair does not announce the decision on the appeal orally in accordance with paragraph 6, the Chair shall indicate the date on which the decision on the appeal is to be despatched, which shall not be later than three months after the closure of the oral proceedings. If the Board is unable to despatch the decision on the appeal by that date, it shall inform the parties and the President of the Boards of Appeal of a new date or, in exceptional circumstances, shall issue a communication specifying the further procedural steps that will be taken.

Article 15a4 Oral proceedings by videoconference

(1)The Board may decide to hold oral proceedings pursuant to Article 116 EPC by videoconference if the Board considers it appropriate to do so, either upon request by a party or of its own motion.

(2)Where oral proceedings are scheduled to be held on the premises of the European Patent Office, a party, representative or accompanying person may, upon request, be allowed to attend by videoconference.

(3)The Chair in the particular appeal and, with the agreement of that Chair, any other member of the Board in the particular appeal may participate in the oral proceedings by videoconference.

Article 16 Costs

(1) Subject to Article 104, paragraph 1, EPC, the Board may on request order a party to pay some or all of another party's costs. Without limiting the Board's discretion, such costs include those incurred by any

(a) amendment to a party's appeal case pursuant to Article 13;

(b) extension of a period;

(c) acts or omissions prejudicing the timely and efficient conduct of oral proceedings;

(d) failure to comply with a direction of the Board;

(e) abuse of procedure.

(2) The costs ordered to be paid may be all or part of those incurred by the receiving party and may, inter alia, be expressed as a percentage or as a specific sum. In the latter event, the Board's decision shall be a final decision for the purposes of Article 104, paragraph 3, EPC. The costs ordered may include costs charged to a party by its professional representative, costs incurred by a party itself whether or not acting through a professional representative, and the costs of witnesses or experts paid by a party but shall be limited to costs necessarily and reasonably incurred.

Article 17 Communications to the parties

(1) In the written phase of proceedings, replies to requests and directions on matters of procedure shall be given by means of communications.

(2) If a Board deems it expedient to communicate with the parties regarding a possible appreciation of substantive or legal matters, such communication shall be made in such a way as not to imply that the Board is in any way bound by it.

Article 18 Right of the President of the European Patent Office to comment

The Board may, of its own motion or at the written, reasoned request of the President of the European Patent Office, invite the President to comment in writing or orally on questions of general interest which arise in the course of proceedings pending before it. The parties shall be entitled to submit their observations on the President's comments.

Article 19 Deliberation and voting

(1) If the members of a Board are not all of the same opinion, the Board shall meet to deliberate regarding the decision to be taken. Only members of the Board shall participate in the deliberations; the Chair in the particular appeal may, however, authorise other officers to attend. The deliberations shall be secret.

(2) During the deliberations of the Board, the opinion of the rapporteur shall be heard first, followed by that of the additional rapporteur if one has been appointed and, if the rapporteur is not the Chair, by that of the Chair last.

(3) If voting is necessary, votes shall be taken in the same sequence, except that the Chair, even when rapporteur, shall vote last. Abstentions shall not be permitted.

Article 20 Deviations from an earlier decision of any Board or from the Guidelines for Examination

(1) Should a Board consider it necessary to deviate from an interpretation or explanation of the Convention given in an earlier decision of any Board, the grounds for this deviation shall be given, unless such grounds are in accordance with an earlier decision or opinion of the Enlarged Board of Appeal according to Article 112, paragraph 1, EPC. The President of the European Patent Office shall be informed of the Board's decision.

(2) If, in its decision, a Board gives a different interpretation of the Convention from that provided for in the Guidelines for Examination, it shall state its grounds for doing so if it considers that the decision will be more readily understood in the light of such grounds.

Article 21 Deviation from an earlier decision or opinion of the Enlarged Board of Appeal

Should a Board consider it necessary to deviate from an interpretation or explanation of the Convention contained in an earlier decision or opinion of the Enlarged Board of Appeal according to Article 112, paragraph 1, EPC, the question shall be referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal.

Article 22 Referral of a question to the Enlarged Board of Appeal

(1) If a question is to be referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal in accordance with Article 112, paragraph 1, EPC, a decision to this effect shall be taken by the Board.

(2) The decision shall contain the items specified in Rule 102 EPC, sub-paragraphs Rule 102(a) EPC, Rule 102(b) EPC, Rule 102(c) EPC, Rule 102(d) EPC and Rule 102(f) EPC, EPC and the question which the Board refers to the Enlarged Board of Appeal. The context in which the question arose shall also be stated.

(3) The decision shall be communicated to the parties.

Article 23 Binding nature of the Rules of Procedure

These Rules of Procedure shall be binding upon the Boards of Appeal, provided that they do not lead to a situation which would be incompatible with the spirit and purpose of the Convention.

Article 24 Entry into force

(1) The revised version of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (the revised version) shall enter into force on 1 January 2020.

(2) Subject to Article 25, the version of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal valid until that time shall cease to be in force upon entry into force of the revised version.

of 5 October 1973

as revised by the Act revising the EPC of 29 November 2000

Section I2

(1)(a) Upon entry into force of the Convention, States parties thereto which are also members of the International Patent Institute set up by the Hague Agreement of 6 June 1947 shall take all necessary steps to ensure the transfer to the European Patent Office no later than the date referred to in Article 162, paragraph 1, of the Convention of all assets and liabilities and all staff members of the International Patent Institute. Such transfer shall be effected by an agreement between the International Patent Institute and the European Patent Organisation. The above States and the other States parties to the Convention shall take all necessary steps to ensure that that agreement shall be implemented no later than the date referred to in Article 162, paragraph 1, of the Convention. Upon implementation of the agreement, those Member States of the International Patent Institute which are also parties to the Convention further undertake to terminate their participation in the Hague Agreement.

(b) The States parties to the Convention shall take all necessary steps to ensure that all the assets and liabilities and all the staff members of the International Patent Institute are taken into the European Patent Office in accordance with the agreement referred to in sub-paragraph (a). After the implementation of that agreement the tasks incumbent upon the International Patent Institute at the date on which the Convention is opened for signature, and in particular those carried out vis-à-vis its Member States, whether or not they become parties to the Convention, and such tasks as it has undertaken at the time of the entry into force of the Convention to carry out vis-à-vis States which, at that date, are both members of the International Patent Institute and parties to the Convention, shall be assumed by the European Patent Office. In addition, the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation may allocate further duties in the field of searching to the European Patent Office.

(c) The above obligations shall also apply mutatis mutandis to the sub-office set up under the Hague Agreement under the conditions set out in the agreement between the International Patent Institute and the Government of the Contracting State concerned. This Government hereby undertakes to make a new agreement with the European Patent Organisation in place of the one already made with the International Patent Institute to harmonise the clauses cocerning the organisation, operation and financing of the sub-office with the provisions of this Protocol.

(2) Subject to the provisions of Section III, the States parties to the Convention shall, on behalf of their central industrial property offices, renounce in favour of the European Patent Office any activities as International Searching Authorities under the Patent Cooperation Treaty as from the date referred to in Article 162, paragraph 1, of the Convention.

(3)(a) A sub-office of the European Patent Office shall be set up in Berlin as from the date referred to in Article 162, paragraph 1, of the Convention. It shall operate under the direction of the branch at The Hague.

(b) The Administrative Council shall determine the duties to be allocated to the sub-office in Berlin in the light of general considerations and of the requirements of the European Patent Office.

(c) At least at the beginning of the period following the progressive expansion of the field of activity of the European Patent Office, the amount of work assigned to that sub-office shall be sufficient to enable the examining staff of the Berlin Annex of the German Patent Office, as it stands at the date on which the Convention is opened for signature, to be fully employed.

(d) The Federal Republic of Germany shall bear any additional costs incurred by the European Patent Organisation in setting up and maintaining the sub-office in Berlin.

Section II

Subject to the provisions of Sections III and IV, the States parties to the Convention shall, on behalf of their central industrial property offices, renounce in favour of the European Patent Office any activities as International Preliminary Examining Authorities under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. This obligation shall apply only to the extent to which the European Patent Office may examine European patent applications in accordance with Article 162, paragraph 2, of the Convention and shall not apply until two years after the date on which the European Patent Office has begun examining activities in the areas of technology concerned, on the basis of a five-year plan which shall progressively extend the activities of the European Patent Office to all areas of technology and which may be amended only by decision of the Administrative Council. The procedures for implementing this obligation shall be determined by decision of the Administrative Council.

Section III

(1) The central industrial property office of any State party to the Convention in which the official language is not one of the official languages of the European Patent Office, shall be authorised to act as an International Searching Authority and as an International Preliminary Examining Authority under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Such authorisation shall be subject to an undertaking by the State concerned to restrict such activities to international applications filed by nationals or residents of such State and by nationals or residents of States parties to the Convention which are adjacent to that State. The Administrative Council may decide to authorise the central industrial property office of any State party to the Convention to extend such activities to cover such international applications as may be filed by nationals or residents of any non-Contracting State having the same official language as the Contracting State in question and drawn up in that language.

(2) For the purpose of harmonising search activities under the Patent Cooperation Treaty within the framework of the European system for the grant of patents, co-operation shall be established between the European Patent Office and any central industrial property office authorised under this Section. Such cooperation shall be based on a special agreement which may cover e.g. search procedures and methods, qualifications required for the recruitment and training of examiners, guidelines for the exchange of search and other services between the offices as well as other measures needed to establish the required control and supervision.

Section IV

(1)(a) For the purpose of facilitating the adaptation of the national patent offices of the States parties to the Convention to the European patent system, the Administrative Council may, if it considers it desirable, and subject to the conditions set out below, entrust the central industrial property offices of such of those States in which it is possible to conduct the proceedings in one of the official languages of the European Patent Office with tasks concerning the examination of European patent applications drawn up in that language which, pursuant to Article 18, paragraph 2, of the Convention, shall, as a general rule, be entrusted to a member of the Examining Division. Such tasks shall be carried out within the framework of the proceedings for grant laid down in the Convention; decisions on such applications shall be taken by the Examining Division composed in accordance with Article 18, paragraph 2 EPC.

(b) Tasks entrusted under sub-paragraph (a) shall not be in respect of more than 40% of the total number of European patent applications filed; tasks entrusted to any one State shall not be in respect of more than one-third of the total number of European patent applications filed. These tasks shall be entrusted for a period of 15 years from the opening of the European Patent Office and shall be reduced progressively (in principle by 20% a year) to zero during the last 5 years of the period.

(c) The Administrative Council shall decide, while taking into account the provisions of sub-paragraph (b), upon the nature, origin and number of the European patent applications in respect of which examining tasks may be entrusted to the central industrial property office of each of the Contracting States mentioned above.

(d) The above implementing procedures shall be set out in a special agreement between the central industrial property office of the Contracting State concerned and the European Patent Organisation.

(e) An office with which such a special agreement has been concluded may act as an International Preliminary Examining Authority under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, until the expiry of the period of 15 years.

(2)(a) If the Administrative Council considers that it is compatible with the proper functioning of the European Patent Office, and in order to alleviate the difficulties which may arise for certain Contracting States from the application of Section I, paragraph 2, it may entrust searching in respect of European patent applications to the central industrial property offices of those States in which the official language is one of the official languages of the European Patent Office, provided that these offices possess the necessary qualifications for appointment as an International Searching Authority in accordance with the conditions laid down in the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

(b) In carrying out such work, undertaken under the responsibility of the European Patent Office, the central industrial property offices concerned shall adhere to the guidelines applicable to the drawing up of the European search report.

(c) The provisions of paragraph 1(b), second sentence, and sub-paragraph (d) of this Section shall apply to this paragraph.

Section V

(1) The sub-office referred to in Section I, paragraph 1(c), shall be authorised to carry out searches, among the documentation which is at its disposal and which is in the official language of the State in which the sub-office is located, in respect of European patent applications filed by nationals and residents of that State. This authorisation shall be on the understanding that the procedure for the grant of European patents will not be delayed and that additional costs will not be incurred for the European Patent Organisation.

(2) The sub-office referred to in paragraph 1 shall be authorised to carry out, at the option of an applicant for a European patent and at his expense, a search on his patent application among the documentation referred to in paragraph 1. This authorisation shall be effective until the search provided for in Article 92 of the Convention has been extended, in accordance with Section VI, to cover such documentation and shall be on the understanding that the procedure for the grant of European patents will not be delayed.

(3) The Administrative Council may also extend the authorisations provided for in paragraphs 1 and paragraphs 2, under the conditions of those paragraphs, to the central industrial property office of a Contracting State which does not have as an official language one of the official languages of the European Patent Office.

Section VI

The search provided for in Article 92 of the Convention shall, in principle, be extended, in respect of all European patent applications, to published patents, published patent applications and other relevant documents of Contracting States not included in the search documentation of the European Patent Office on the date referred to in Article 162, paragraph 1, of the Convention. The extent, conditions and timing of any such extension shall be determined by the Administrative Council on the basis of a study concerning particularly the technical and financial aspects.

Section VII

The provisions of this Protocol shall prevail over any contradictory provisions of the Convention.

Section VIII

The decisions of the Administrative Council provided for in this Protocol shall require a three-quarters majority (Article 35, paragraph 2, of the Convention). The provisions governing the weighting of votes (Article 36 of the Convention) shall apply.

The new text of the Protocol adopted by the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation in its decision of 28 June 2001 (see OJ EPO 2001, Special edition No. 4, p. 55) has become an integral part of the Revision Act of 29 November 2000 under Article 3(2), second sentence, of that Act.

2Amended by the Act revising the European Patent Convention of 29.11.2000.Protocol on Jurisdiction and the Recognition of Decisions in respect of the Right to the Grant of a European Patent (Protocol on Recognition)

of 5 October 1973

Section I Jurisdiction

Article 1

(1) The courts of the Contracting States shall, in accordance with Articles 2 to 6, have jurisdiction to decide claims, against the applicant, to the right to the grant of a European patent in respect of one or more of the Contracting States designated in the European patent application.

Article 3

Subject to Articles 4 and 5, if an applicant for a European patent has his residence or principal place of business outside the Contracting States, and if the party claiming the right to the grant of the European patent has his residence or principal place of business within one of the Contracting States, the courts of the latter State shall have exclusive jurisdiction.

Article 4

Article 5

(1) If the parties to a dispute concerning the right to the grant of a European patent have concluded an agreement, either in writing or verbally with written confirmation, to the effect that a court or the courts of a particular Contracting State shall decide on such a dispute, the court or courts of that State shall have exclusive jurisdiction.

(2) However, if the parties are an employee and his employer, paragraph 1 shall only apply in so far as the national law governing the contract of employment allows the agreement in question.

(1) Subject to the provisions of Article 11, paragraph 2, final decisions given in any Contracting State on the right to the grant of a European patent in respect of one or more of the Contracting States designated in the European patent application shall be recognised without requiring a special procedure in the other Contracting States.

Article 23

(1) Any Contracting State may submit to an international arbitration tribunal any dispute concerning the Organisation or an employee of the European Patent Office or an expert performing functions for or on its behalf, in so far as the Organisation or the employees and experts have claimed a privilege or an immunity under this Protocol in circumstances where that immunity has not been waived.

(2) If a Contracting State intends to submit a dispute to arbitration, it shall notify the Chairman of the Administrative Council, who shall forthwith inform each Contracting State of such notification.

(3) The procedure laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to disputes between the Organisation and the employees or experts in respect of the Service Regulations or conditions of employment or, with regard to the employees, the Pension Scheme Regulations.

Article 24

(1) The arbitration tribunal referred to in Article 23 shall consist of three members, one arbitrator nominated by the State or States party to the arbitration, one arbitrator nominated by the Administrative Council and a third arbitrator, who shall be the chairman, nominated by the said two arbitrators.

(2) The arbitrators shall be nominated from a panel comprising no more than six arbitrators appointed by each Contracting State and six arbitrators appointed by the Administrative Council. This panel shall be established as soon as possible after the Protocol enters into force and shall be revised each time this proves necessary.

(3) If, within three months from the date of the notification referred to in Article 23, paragraph 2, either party fails to make the nomination referred to in paragraph 1 above, the choice of the arbitrator shall, on request of the other party, be made by the President of the International Court of Justice from the persons included in the said panel. This shall also apply, when so requested by either party, if within one month from the date of appointment of the second arbitrator, the first two arbitrators are unable to agree on the nomination of the third arbitrator. However, if, in these two cases, the President of the International Court of Justice is prevented from making the choice, or if he is a national of one of the States parties to the dispute, the Vice-President of the International Court of Justice shall make the aforementioned appointments, provided that he himself is not a national of one of the States parties to the dispute; if such is the case, the member of the International Court of Justice who is not a national of one of the States parties to the dispute and who has been chosen by the President or Vice-President shall make the appointments. A national of the State applying for arbitration may not be chosen to fill the post of the arbitrator whose appointment devolves on the Administrative Council nor may a person included in the panel and appointed by the Administrative Council be chosen to fill the post of an arbitrator whose appointment devolves on the State which is the claimant. Nor may a person of either of these categories be chosen as chairman of the Tribunal.

(4) The arbitration tribunal shall draw up its own rules of procedure.

Article 25

The Organisation may, on a decision of the Administrative Council, conclude with one or more Contracting States complementary agreements to give effect to the provisions of this Protocol as regards such State or States, and other arrangements to ensure the efficient functioning of the Organisation and the safeguarding of its interests.

RuleGuidelines for Examination

Guidelines for Examination in the European Patent Office

March 2023 2024

List of ContentsPart A Guidelines for Formalities Examination

ContentsChapter I – Introduction

1. Overview

2. Responsibility for formalities examination

3. Purpose of Part A

4. Other parts relating to formalities1. Overview

Part A of the Guidelines deals with:

(i)the requirements and procedures to be followed in the various aspects of the formalities examination of European patent applications (chapters A‑II to A-VI)

(ii)formalities matters of a more general nature that can arise during the application procedure or post-grant stage (chapters A‑VII and A-VIII)

(iii)the presentation and execution of drawings and figurative representations accompanying a European patent application (chapter A‑IX)

(iv)fee matters (chapter A‑X)

(v)inspection of files, communication of information contained in files, consultation of the European Patent Register and issue of certified copies (chapter A‑XI).2. Responsibility for formalities examination

The matters covered in this part are intended for EPO formalities staff at all sites (The Hague, Munich and Berlin) and in particular for the Receiving Section, which is specifically responsible under the EPC for ensuring that the formal requirements for European patent applications are met. Once an application is transferred to the examining division, the latter accepts responsibility for the formalities of the application, although it should be understood that the term "examining division" is intended to include the formalities officer to whom this work is entrusted (see the decisions of the President of the EPO dated 12 December 2013, OJ EPO 2014, A6, 23 November 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A104, and 14 June 2020, OJ EPO 2020, A80).

Rule 10 Rule 11(3)3. Purpose of Part A

This part of the Guidelines is intended to provide formalities officers with the knowledge and background to help them carry out their duties efficiently and uniformly. It does not override the EPC (see, in particular, section 3 of the General Part).4. Other parts relating to formalities

Formalities officers should not concern themselves with only Part A of the Guidelines. They will need to refer frequently to the other parts and in particular Part E, where appropriate.Chapter II – Filing of applications and examination on filing

1. Where and how applications may be filed

2. Persons entitled to file an application

3. Procedure on filing

4. Examination on filing

5. Late filing of missing drawings or missing parts of the description

6. Correction of erroneously filed application documents or parts1. Where and how applications may be filed

European patent applications must be filed in writing. They may be filed by means of electronic communication (see A‑II, 1.1) or by delivery by hand or , by postal services (see A‑II, 1.1) or by means of electronic communication (see A‑II, 1.2).

1.1Filing of applications by delivery by hand or by postal services

Rule 1 Rule 2(1)

European patent applications may be filed by delivery by hand or by postal services at the EPO's filing offices in Munich, The Hague or Berlin. The EPO's sub-office in Vienna is not a filing office, nor is the Brussels Bureau.

The opening hours of the EPO's filing offices are published in the notice from the EPO dated 14 February 2018, OJ EPO 2018, A18. Dates on which at least one of the filing offices is not open to receive documents are announced at regular intervals in the EPO Official Journal (see also E‑VIII, 1.4). The filing offices may remain open during public holidays observed in the contracting states in which they are located. Since mail is not delivered on these days (see also E‑VIII, 1.4), applications may be filed by delivery by hand or using other permitted means of filing (see A‑II, 1.2; A‑II, 1.3).

The EPO filing offices in Berlin and Munich (PschorrHöfe building only, see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 3 January 2017, OJ EPO 2017, A11) are equipped with automated mailboxes, which may be used at any time. The automated mailbox facility is currently not available at the filing offices at Munich's Isar building and The Hague. Outside office hours documents may be handed in to the porter.

European patent applications (with the exception of divisional applications, see A‑IV, 1.3.1, and applications according to Art. 61(1)(b) EPC, see A‑IV, 2.5) may also be filed at the central industrial property office or other competent authority of a contracting state if permitted by that state's national law (see A‑II, 1.6).

Applications may also be filed by fax with the EPO's filing offices or with the competent national authorities of contracting states that permit this, namely – at present – Austria (AT), Bulgaria (BG), Czech Republic (CZ), Estonia (EE), Finland (FI), France (FR), Germany (DE), Iceland (IS), Ireland (IE), Luxembourg (LU), Monaco (MC), Norway (NO), Portugal (PT), Slovenia (SI), Spain (ES), Sweden (SE) and United Kingdom (GB). For further details, see the latest version of the booklet "National law relating to the EPC".

If a faxed application is illegible or incomplete, it is to be treated as not having been received to the extent that it is illegible or that the attempted transmission failed, and the sender must be notified as soon as possible (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 20 February 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A18).

If a European patent application is filed by fax, a written confirmation is required only where the documents are of inferior quality. In this case, the EPO will invite the applicant to supply such documents within two months (Rule 2(1)). If the applicant fails to comply with this invitation in due time, the European patent application will be refused. To prevent duplication of files, applicants are asked to indicate on the paper version of the application documents the application number or fax date and the name of the authority with which the documents were filed and to make it clear that these documents represent "confirmation of an application filed by fax".

1.1.1 Filing of applications in electronic form

1.1.2 Filing of applications by fax1.1.1 1.2.2 Filing of applications in electronic form

European patent applications and international (PCT) applications may also be filed electronically with the EPO in electronically form (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 May 2021, OJ EPO 2021, 3 May 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A48) using either

(i)EPO Online Filing (OLF), by packaging and submitting the documents using the software provided by the EPO (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 8 July 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A70 24 November 2023 concerning the version of the EPO Online Filing software to the used for the electronic filing of documents, OJ EPO 2023, A96) unless the use of other software is permitted. Filings using OLF may be made online or on electronic data carriers accepted by the EPO. At present, they are CD-R discs conforming to the ISO 9660 standard and DVD-R or DVD+R discs (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 May 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A42 3 May 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A48)

Certain procedural acts may be filed electronically using the MyEPO Portfolio service (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 11 May 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A51 9 October 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A89, the notice from the EPO dated 9 October 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A90, and the notice from the EPO dated 11 May 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A52 3 May 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A50). Currently, only those documents specified in the above decision or in an announcement on the EPO website or in the EPO Official Journal may be filed using this service.

European patent applications may also be filed in electronic form electronically with the competent national authorities of those contracting states that permit this.1.1.2 1.2.1 Filing of applications by fax

Applications may also be filed by fax with the EPO's filing offices in Munich, The Hague or Berlin (see A‑II, 1.2) or with the competent national authorities of contracting states that permit this, namely – at present – Austria (AT), Bulgaria (BG), Czech Republic (CZ), Estonia (EE), Finland (FI), France (FR), Germany (DE), Iceland (IS), Ireland (IE), Luxembourg (LU), Monaco (MC), Norway (NO), Portugal (PT), Slovenia (SI), Sweden (SE) and United Kingdom (GB). For further details, see the latest version of the booklet "National law relating to the EPC" available on the EPO website (epo.org).

If a faxed application is illegible or incomplete, it is to be treated as not having been received to the extent that it is illegible or that the attempted transmission failed, and the sender must be notified as soon as possible (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 20 February 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A18).

To prevent duplication of files, applicants are asked to indicate on the paper version of the application documents the application number or fax date and the name of the authority with which the documents were filed and to make it clear that these documents represent "confirmation of an application filed by fax".1.2 1.1 Filing of applications by delivery by hand or by postal services

European patent applications may be filed by delivery by hand or by postal services at the EPO's filing offices in Munich, The Hague or Berlin. The EPO's sub-office in Vienna is not a filing office, nor is the Brussels Bureau.

The opening hours of the EPO's filing offices are published in the notice from the EPO dated 14 February 2018, OJ EPO 2018, A18. Dates on which at least one of the filing offices is not open to receive documents are announced at regular intervals in the EPO Official Journal (see also E‑VIII, 1.4). The filing offices may remain open during public holidays observed in the contracting states in which they are located. Since mail is not delivered on these days (see also E‑VIII, 1.4), applications may be filed by delivery by hand or using other permitted means of filing (see A‑II, 1.1; A‑II, 1.3).

The EPO filing offices in Berlin and Munich's PschorrHöfe building (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 3 January 2017, OJ EPO 2017, A11) are equipped with automated mailboxes, which may be used at any time. The automated mailbox facility is currently not available at the filing offices in Munich's Isar building and The Hague. Outside office hours documents may be handed in to the porter.

European patent applications (with the exception of divisional applications, see A‑IV, 1.3.1, and applications according to Art. 61(1)(b), see A‑IV, 2.5) may also be filed at the central industrial property office or other competent authority of a contracting state if permitted by that state's national law (see A‑II, 1.6). First filings may need to be filed at national offices (see A‑II, 3.2 and the booklet "National law relating to the EPC" on epo.org).

Art. 75(1) Rule 35(1)1.3 Filing of applications by other means

The filing of European patent applications by other means such as email is at present not allowed (see also the notice from the EPO dated 12 September 2000, OJ EPO 2000, 458).1.4 Subsequent filing of documents

For the subsequent filing of documents, see A‑VIII, 2.5.1.5 Debit orders for deposit accounts held with the EPO

For European patent applications, debit orders for the fees due must be filed in an accepted electronic format (see A‑X, 4.2.3), irrespective of how the application itself is filed. If an application is filed with a competent national authority (Art. 75(1)(b)) on paper, a paper debit order on mandatory Form 1020 for the fees intended to be paid is accepted by way of exception if it is included with that application on filing (see the Arrangements for deposit accounts (ADA), Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2022, Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2023, 10, and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 13 June 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A58). Paper Form 1020 is not accepted if filed direct with the EPO.

Point 7.1.2 ADA Point 12.1 ADA1.6 Forwarding of applications

The central industrial property office of a contracting state is obliged to forward applications filed (see A‑II, 3.2) with it or with other competent authorities in that state to the EPO in the shortest time compatible with its national law on the secrecy of inventions (for debit order enclosures, see A‑II, 1.5).

Art. 77(1) Rule 37(1)

A time limit of six weeks after filing is specified for the onward transmission to the EPO of applications not classified as secret. This is extended to four months or, where priority has been claimed, to 14 months after the date of priority, for applications requiring further examination as to their classification as secret. An application received outside the specified time limits, either six weeks or four months, must be processed, provided it is received in Munich, The Hague or Berlin before the end of the 14th month after filing or, where appropriate, after the date of priority. Applications received after 14 months are deemed withdrawn. Re-establishment of rights and further processing in respect of the period under Rule 37(2) are not possible, since the loss of rights does not result from the applicant's failure to observe a time limit (see J 3/80). However, the applicant may file a request for conversion under Art. 135(1)(a) (see A‑IV, 6).

Art. 77(3) Rule 37(2) Art. 135(1)(a)

If the time limit referred to in Rule 37(2) expires on a day on which the delivery or transmission of mail is interrupted or subsequently dislocated within the meaning of Rule 134(2), it will extend to the first day following the end of the period of interruption or dislocation.

Rule 134(2)1.7 Application numbering systems

1.7.1 Applications filed before 1 January 2002

1.7.2 Applications filed on or after 1 January 20021.7.1 Applications filed before 1 January 2002

For applications filed before 1 January 2002, the following numbering system applies:

The application number consists of nine digits. The first two digits (from left to right) indicate the filing year. The last (ninth) digit is a check digit. The third digit or third and fourth digits indicate(s) the place of filing.

The remaining digits are used for consecutively numbering the applications in the order in which they arrive at the place of filing.

International applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and designating "EP" (Euro-PCT applications) receive the digit "7", "8" or "9" as the third digit.1.7.2 Applications filed on or after 1 January 2002

For applications filed on or after 1 January 2002, the following numbering system applies:

The application number consists of nine digits. The first two digits (from left to right) indicate the filing year. The last digit is a check digit. The remaining six digits in between are used for consecutively numbering the applications in the order in which they arrive at the place of filing, starting from the lowest number within a specific range of six-digit numbers. The specific range reflects the place of filing. Where applicable, the range is subdivided into two ranges to distinguish between online and paper filings.

For international applications designating "EP" (Euro-PCT applications), the dedicated range for the six-digit number within the application number uses "7", "8" or "9" as the third digit and does not reflect the place or method of filing.

A list of the number ranges introduced in 2002, along with, where appropriate, the corresponding places of filing, is published in OJ EPO 2001, 465.2. Persons entitled to file an application

A European patent application may be filed by any natural or legal person, or any body equivalent to a legal person by virtue of the law governing it.

Art. 58

For the purposes of proceedings before the EPO, the applicant will be deemed to be entitled to exercise the right to the European patent.

Art. 60(3)

The application may be in the name of one person or several persons may be named as joint applicants. The application may also be filed by two or more applicants designating different contracting states. It may arise that a first applicant designates one group of contracting states and a second designates a different group of contracting states, while both applicants jointly designate a third group of contracting states. If the applicants for a patent are not the same for different contracting states they will be regarded as joint applicants in proceedings before the EPO (see A‑III, 4.2.1 and A-III, 11.1 on when and under what circumstances the matter dealt with in this paragraph must be considered during formalities examination).

Art. 59 Art. 118

If a national court finds that a person other than the applicant is entitled to the grant of a European patent that person has the option of prosecuting the application as their own application in place of the applicant (see A‑IV, 2).

Art. 61(1)3. Procedure on filing

3.1 Receipt; confirmation

3.2 Filing with a competent national authority3.1 Receipt; confirmation

The receipt of European patent applications filed online via EPO Online Filing, Online Filing 2.0 or the EPO web-form filing service is acknowledged electronically during the following submission session. Where it becomes apparent that the acknowledgment's transmission failed, the authority with which the application was filed promptly transmits the acknowledgment by other means where possible on the basis of the information supplied (see Art. 13 of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 May 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A42 3 May 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A48).

The receipt of European patent applications filed using the EPO Contingency Upload Service is confirmed electronically by the EPO in the service itself. An acknowledgment of receipt indicating the application number assigned is sent separately in accordance with the provisions governing the filing of documents on paper (see following paragraph).

The acknowledgement of receipt of European patent applications filed on paper (usually the last page of EPO Form 1001) is issued by the authority with which the application is filed – either the EPO (Munich, The Hague or Berlin) or the competent national authority. The receipt must be issued without delay and include the application number and the date of receipt.

Rule 35(2)3.2 Filing with a competent national authority

If the application is filed with a competent national authority, that authority must inform the EPO without delay of receipt of the documents making up the application and indicate the nature and date of receipt of the documents, the application number and any priority date claimed. It is recommended that the authority should also indicate the applicant's or representative's reference number, where provided. In practice, the EPO receives the above information when the actual application is forwarded to it unless national security checks by the national authority delay the forwarding of the application, in which case a separate notice is sent by that authority to the EPO.

Rule 35(3)

When the EPO receives an application forwarded by the national authority of a contracting state, it notifies the applicant, indicating the date of receipt at the EPO. Once this communication has been received, all further documents relating to the application must be sent direct to the EPO.

Rule 35(4)

Where an application is not received by the EPO from the national authority of a contracting state before the end of the 14th month after filing or, if priority has been claimed, after the date of priority and is consequently deemed withdrawn (see A‑II, 1.6), the applicant must be notified accordingly; all fees must be refunded, including any fees paid in advance of their due date.

Art. 77(3) Rule 37(2) Rule 112(1)4. Examination on filing

4.1 Minimum requirements for according a date of filing4.1 Minimum requirements for according a date of filing

The EPO examines applications to determine whether they meet the minimum requirements for according a date of filing. This is done by the Receiving Section. These requirements are satisfied where the documents filed contain:

Art. 90(1) Rule 10(1)

(a)an indication that a European patent is sought

Rule 40(1)(a)

(b)information identifying the applicant or allowing the applicant to be contacted

Rule 40(1)(b)

(c)a description or reference to a single previously filed application.

It is not necessary for the applicant to provide any claims to obtain a filing date. If the application is filed without claims but satisfies all requirements for obtaining a filing date, the applicant will be requested to provide at least one claim later according to Rules 57(c) and Rule 58 (see A‑III, 15).

Where the description is filed by reference to a previously filed application (see A‑II, 4.1.3.1), the reference must contain the following information for the application to qualify for a filing date according to Rule 40(2):

(i)the filing date of the previously filed application

(ii)its file number

(iii)the office where it was filed

(iv)an indication that this reference replaces the description and any drawings.

Rule 40(1)(c)

To be accorded a filing date, these documents do not have to meet any particular requirements as to form or presentation. They must, however, be sufficiently legible to enable the information to be discerned.

Rule 1

4.1.1 Indication that a European patent is sought

4.1.2 Information concerning the applicant

4.1.3 Description

4.1.4 Deficiencies

4.1.5 Date of filing4.1.1 Indication that a European patent is sought

Applicants must use Use of the prescribed request for grant form (EPO Form 1001), which is available in the EPO Online Filing and Online Filing 2.0's online filing tools (see A‑II, 1.1.1 A‑II, 1.2.2) or can be downloaded free of charge from the EPO website (epo.org), to meet the requirement referred to in A‑II, 4.1(a) to provide "the indication that a patent is sought" (see also A‑III, 4).4.1.2 Information concerning the applicant

For the purposes of establishing a filing date, information must be supplied which:

(i)identifies the applicant or

(ii)allows the applicant to be contacted.

If there are multiple applicants, the above information has to be supplied for only one of them. Any kind of information that allows the applicant to be contacted will be considered to fulfil requirement (ii), for example:

(a)the name and address of the applicant's representative

(b)a PO box number

(c)a phone number.

If the information supplied is sufficient to establish a filing date but not for the EPO to establish whether or not the applicant requires a representative according to Art. 133(2), the procedure outlined in A‑III, 16 will be followed.

In deciding whether the applicant information supplied satisfies the requirements for establishing a filing date, the EPO will take into account all data contained in the documents filed (see J 25/86). Objection should not be raised at this stage with regard to the status of the applicant or the entitlement to apply, or where, in the case of joint applicants, there is doubt as to the contracting states designated by the individual applicants.4.1.3 Description

The contents of the description do not require close scrutiny – it is sufficient to identify a document (or documents) that appear(s) to include a description. If, instead of filing a description, the applicant files a reference to a previously filed application, see A‑II, 4.1.3.1.

4.1.3.1 Reference to a previously filed application4.1.3.1 Reference to a previously filed application

Instead of application documents, the applicant can file a reference to a previously filed application under Rule 40(1)(c). The previously filed application referenced does not need to be claimed as priority.

Details required on the filing date

Under Rule 40(2), to qualify for a filing date, the applicant must indicate the following details on the filing date:

(i)the filing date of the previously filed application

(ii)its file number

(iii)the office where it was filed

(iv)an indication that this reference replaces the description and any drawings.

The previously filed application referenced may also be an application for a utility model.

Rule 40(2)

Copy of the previously filed application

The applicant must supply a copy of the previously filed application certified as correct by the authority with which it was filed within two months of the filing date (Rule 40(3)). However, according to Rule 40(3), last sentence, this requirement is dispensed with where the previously filed application is already available to the EPO under the conditions specified by the President. According to the notice from the EPO dated 14 September 2009, OJ EPO 2009, 486, a certified copy does not need to be filed where the previously filed application is a Euro-direct application or an international one filed with the EPO as receiving Office under the PCT. In all other cases, a certified copy of the previously filed application referenced must be filed within the time limit under Rule 40(3).

Where the previously filed application referenced is the claimed priority application, only one certified copy needs to be filed to satisfy the requirements relating to both the filing date (Rule 40(3)) and the priority claim (Rule 53(1), see A‑III, 6.7).

For divisional applications filed by reference, see A‑IV, 1.3.1.

Rule 40(3) Rule 53(2)

Translation of the previously filed application

If the previously filed application is not in an official EPO language, the applicant must also file a translation into one such language within two months of the filing date (Rule 40(3)). If the translation of the previously filed application is already available to the EPO, a copy of it will be included in the file free of charge and the applicant will not need to file it (Rule 40(3)).

Note that where the previously filed application is in an official language of an EPC contracting state according to Art. 14(4), the application may qualify for a reduction of the filing fee, provided that the applicant is entitled to a reduction according to Rule 6(3) in conjunction with Rule 6(4) to Rule 6(7) (see A‑X, 9.2.1 and A-X, 9.2.2). The reduction applies even in cases where the description is filed by reference to a previously filed application according to Rule 40(1)(c), where the previously filed application is in a language specified in Art. 14(4) but the claims are filed after the filing date in accordance with Rule 57(c) and Rule 58 and in an official EPO language. This is because the essential element for establishing a filing date (the provision of a description, see Rule 40(1)(c)) has been provided in a language giving rise to the entitlement to the reduction (see G 6/91, mutatis mutandis).

The claims

Applicants can also indicate that the reference to the previously filed application should also replace the claims (Rule 57(c)). This must be done on the filing date, preferably by selecting the appropriate box on the request for grant (EPO Form 1001). In that case, the previously filed application's claims will form the basis for the search and, as they satisfy the requirement of Rule 57(c), the applicant will not be invited to file claims later.

If applicants do not refer to the previously filed application's claims but only to the description and any drawings, they may file a set of claims at the same time as the reference (i.e. on the filing date). If they do not do so, the Receiving Section will invite them under Rule 58 to file claims (see A‑III, 15).

Rule 40(3)4.1.4 Deficiencies

If the EPO (Receiving Section) notes either of the following deficiencies:

– Rule 40(1)(a) – no indication that a European patent is sought or

– Rule 40(1)(c) – no description or reference to a previously filed application,

either of which prevents the application being accorded a filing date, it communicates this to the applicants and invites them to remedy the deficiency within a non-extendable period of two months from notification of a communication under Rule 55. If the requirements of Rule 40(1)(a) or Rule 40(1)(c), as applicable, are not met at the end of this period, the application will not be dealt with as a European patent application. The EPO will notify the applicant accordingly under Rule 112(1). In reply, the applicant may file a request for a decision under Rule 112(2) (see E‑VIII, 1.9.3) or request re-establishment of rights under Art. 122 and Rule 136 (see E‑VIII, 3).

If none of the available means of redress is filed on time, any fees paid are refunded. If the applicant wishes to pursue a European patent application, all documents relating to the purported application will have to be re-filed. Any such re-filed application will be accorded as the filing date the date on which all the requirements of Rule 40 are fulfilled.

Deficiency under Rule 40(1)(b)

If the information on the applicants is missing or does not enable the EPO to contact them (Rule 40(1)(b)), a communication concerning the deficiency cannot be sent. The European patent application will not come into existence unless the applicants correct this deficiency on their own initiative within two months of the date of receipt of the original documents. In this case, the filing date is the date on which all the requirements of Rule 40 are met.

Filing by reference to a previously filed application

Where the application is filed by reference to a previously filed application and the EPO (Receiving Section) notes that any of the following information is missing:

(i)the filing date of the previously filed application

(ii)its file number

(iii)the office where it was filed

(iv)an indication that this reference replaces the description and any drawings

then it proceeds as above and invites the applicant to remedy the deficiency within a two-month time limit (Rule 55). If the applicant does not remedy the deficiencies in due time, the application is not treated as a European patent application.

If the applicant does not provide the certified copy of the previously filed application within two months of filing the application (Rule 40(3)) and it is not already available to the EPO (see A‑II, 4.1.3.1), then a communication according to Rule 55 will be sent to the applicant requesting that the certified copy be filed within a non-extendable period of two months. If the applicant does not provide the certified copy in due time, the application is not treated as a European patent application. Where a translation of the application is required but is not provided within the above time limit, the procedure given in A‑III, 14 is followed. The filing date is unaffected by a missing translation.

Art. 90(1) and Art. 90(2) Rule 55 Rule 112(1)4.1.5 Date of filing

The filing date accorded to the application is the date the application meets the requirements of Rule 40 and is either:

(i)the date of receipt at the EPO or competent national authority or

(ii)the date, not later than the two-month period referred to in Rule 55, on which the applicant rectifies any deficiencies. The applicant is informed of the filing date accorded to the application in this case.

Case (ii) is subject to one exception. Where the application is filed by reference to a previously filed application and the applicants fail to file the certified copy of the previously filed application within two months of the filing date as required by Rule 40(3), an invitation is sent to them to file it within two months of a communication according to Rule 55. If they file the certified copy within this two-month period, the application maintains its original filing date, provided that all other requirements for acquiring a filing date have been met.

The filing date may also change in cases where the applicant inserts missing parts of the description or missing drawings under Rule 56 (see A‑II, 5) or corrects erroneously filed parts under Rule 56a (see A‑II, 6) after the filing date.5. Late filing of missing drawings or missing parts of the description

5.1 Late filing of missing drawings or missing parts of the description – on invitation

5.2 Late filing of missing drawings or missing parts of the description – without invitation

5.3 The filing date changes

5.4 Missing parts of the description or missing drawings based on the priority application, no change in filing date

5.5 Withdrawal of late-filed missing drawings or missing parts of the description

5.6 Additional fee for pages5.1 Late filing of missing drawings or missing parts of the description – on invitation

The application is examined on filing to check that it is entitled to a filing date. If, during this check, the EPO notes that parts of the description or drawings appear to be missing, it will invite the applicant to file the missing parts within a time limit of two months of a communication under Rule 56(1) and Rule 56a(1) (see A‑II, 6). During this time limit, the applicant may proceed under Rule 56 or Rule 56a. If the applicant does not reply to this communication in time, then all references to the missing parts are deemed deleted. It should be noted that the applicant may not invoke the omission of the communication under Rule 56(1) and Rule 56a(1).

Art. 90(1) Rule 56(1) Rule 56(4)(a) Rule 56a(1)5.2 Late filing of missing drawings or missing parts of the description – without invitation

Applicants may also file missing parts of the description or missing drawings on their own initiative (without being invited to do so by the EPO) within two months of the original filing date. If the applicant does not do so within this period, all references to the missing parts are deemed deleted. If the applicant is invited by the EPO to file the missing parts, the period under Rule 56(1) takes precedence (see A‑II, 5.1).

If, within two months of the original filing date, applicants notice that parts of the description or drawings are missing in the application as originally filed, they should, on their own initiative, file the missing parts or missing drawings as soon as possible under Rule 56(2) because, in the absence of a communication from the EPO sent under Rule 56(1) and Rule 56a(1), the possibility for applicants to file any missing or correct parts ends two months after the original filing date.

Rule 56(2) Rule 56(4)(a)

Further processing is ruled out for the time limits referred to in Rule 56 (Rule 135(2)).

Rule 135(2)5.3 The filing date changes

If the applicant files missing parts of the description or missing drawings in accordance with the procedure specified in A‑II, 5.1 or A-II, 5.2, then the filing date changes to the date on which the missing parts are received at the EPO. The applicant is informed of the new filing date. This is subject to the exception explained in A‑II, 5.4.

A "drawing" means a single numbered figure. Only whole figures are accepted according to Rule 56, even where only a part of the original figure was missing.

Rule 56(2)5.4 Missing parts of the description or missing drawings based on the priority application, no change in filing date

If the applicant files missing parts of the description or missing drawings after the filing date in accordance with the procedure specified in A‑II, 5.1 or A-II, 5.2, the filing date does not change, provided that all of the following criteria are satisfied:

(i)the missing parts are filed within the applicable time limit*

(ii)the application claims priority on the date on which the requirements laid down in Rule 40(1) were fulfilled (see A‑II, 4.1 and A‑II, 5.4.1)

(iii)the applicant requests that the late-filed missing parts be based on the claimed priority in order to avoid a change in the filing date (see A‑II, 5.4.1), and does so within the applicable time limit*

(iv)the late-filed missing parts of the description or missing drawings are completely contained in the priority application (see A‑II, 5.4.2)

Rule 56(3)

(v)the applicant files a copy of the priority application within the applicable time limit* unless such a copy is already available to the EPO under Rule 53(2) (see A‑II, 5.4.3)

Rule 56(3)(a)

(vi)where the priority application is not in an official EPO language, the applicant files a translation into one such language within the applicable time limit* unless such a translation is already available to the EPO under Rule 53(3) (see A‑II, 5.4.4)

Rule 56(3)(b)

(vii)the applicant indicates where in the priority application and, if applicable, where in its translation, the late-filed missing parts of the description or missing drawings are completely contained, and does so within the applicable time limit* (see A‑II, 5.4.2).

For the applicable time limit, see whichever of A‑II, 5.1 or A-II, 5.2 applies.

Where the conditions for including the missing parts of the description or missing drawings under Rule 56(3) are fulfilled, the filing date remains unchanged. The EPO will inform the applicant of this in accordance with Rule 56(3).

Where criterion (i) is not satisfied, the late filing of missing parts is deemed not to have occurred and all references to those parts in the application are deemed deleted under Rule 56(4)(a) (see A‑II, 5.1 and A-II, 5.2). In this case the filing date does not change but nor are the late-filed missing parts introduced into the application.

Rule 56(3)(c)

If the request according to Rule 56(3) does not comply with one or more of the above requirements (ii)-(iv), then according to Rule 56(2) the filing date changes to the date on which the EPO receives the late-filed missing parts of the application. The EPO will inform the applicant of this in accordance with Rule 56(2).

Rule 56(2)

If the request according to Rule 56(3) does not comply with one or more of the above requirements (v)-(vii), then according to Rule 56(5) the filing date changes to the date on which the EPO receives the late-filed missing parts of the application. The EPO will inform the applicant of this in accordance with Rule 56(5).

Rule 56(5)

5.4.1 Late-filed missing parts when priority is claimed

5.4.2 The missing parts of the description or missing drawings are completely contained in the priority application

5.4.3 Copy of the priority application

5.4.4 Translation of the priority application5.4.1 Late-filed missing parts when priority is claimed

In the case of a request under Rule 56(3), the EPO checks that the requirements for the priority claim are met (see A‑III, 6).

Where the applicant files a request under Rule 56(3) (see A‑II, 5.4), the priority claim in question must have been in existence no later than on the date on which the requirements laid down in Rule 40(1) were first fulfilled (see A‑II, 4.1).

Rule 40(1)5.4.2 The missing parts of the description or missing drawings are completely contained in the priority application

In cases where no translation of the priority application is required and both the European patent application and the priority application are in the same official EPO language, the requirement that the late-filed parts of the application be "completely contained" in the priority application is met only if the parts of the priority application identified by the applicant according to Rule 56(3)(c) contain the same drawings with the same annotations or, for late-filed parts of the description, contain the same text.

If a translation of the priority application is required, then the requirement that the late-filed parts of the application be "completely contained" in the priority application is met only if the parts of the translation identified by the applicant according to Rule 56(3)(c) contain the same drawings with the same annotations or, for late-filed parts of the description, contain the same text.

In addition to the requirement that the missing drawings or the missing parts of the description be identical to the corresponding drawings or parts of the priority application, they must also be inserted in the description in a manner that does not result in additional technical content. Drawings of low visual quality are not considered missing within the meaning of Rule 56 and can, therefore, not be remedied under this provision (see J 12/14). However, it may be possible to remedy drawings of low visual quality under Rule 56a (see A‑II, 6).

Final assessment of the "completely contained" requirement falls under the responsibility of the examining division (see C‑III, 1).

Rule 56a5.4.3 Copy of the priority application

The copy of the priority application that is required for the request according to Rule 56(3) does not need to be certified. However, if the applicants do provide a certified copy for their request according to Rule 56(3), they will not need to provide it again for their priority claim according to Rule 53(1).

Where a copy of the priority document is already available to the EPO under Rule 53(2) in accordance with the conditions laid down by the President, the applicant does not need to file it. See also A‑III, 6.7.5.4.4 Translation of the priority application

Where a translation of the priority application is already available to the EPO under Rule 53(2), the applicant does not need to file it.

In cases where the priority application is in an official EPO language and the European patent application is in a different official EPO language, the applicant is not required to file a translation of the priority application according to Rule 56(3)(b). However, since the language of the priority application differs from that of the European patent application, the requirement that the newly introduced drawings (if they contain annotations) or parts of the description be "completely contained" in the priority application (Rule 56(3)) is not met.

This can be overcome by the applicant's supplying within the applicable time limit (see whichever of A‑II, 5.1 or A-II, 5.2 applies), either:

(i)a translation from the official language of the priority application into the official language of the European patent application of those parts of the priority application identified by the applicant as completely containing the missing parts of the description or missing drawings (Rule 56(3)(c)) or

(ii)a declaration indicating that the late-filed missing parts of the description or missing drawings are an exact translation of the parts of the priority application identified by the applicant according to Rule 56(3)(c).

The entire priority application does not need to be translated, since this translation is required to satisfy the "completely contained" requirement of Rule 56(3), not the translation requirement of Rule 56(3)(b).5.5 Withdrawal of late-filed missing drawings or missing parts of the description

Where applicants file missing parts of the description or missing drawings and make no request to base these late-filed parts on a claimed priority, they are informed of the new filing date in a communication from the EPO (see A‑II, 5.3). Within one month of this communication, the applicants may withdraw the late-filed parts of the application and if they do so, the redating of the application is deemed not to have taken place and all references to the missing parts of the description or missing drawings are deemed deleted. The EPO will inform the applicants of this.

Rule 56(2) and (4)

Where applicants file missing parts of the description or missing drawings and request that these late-filed parts be based on a claimed priority, but the requirements of Rule 56(3) are not met within the applicable time limit, the filing date changes to the date on which the late-filed parts of the application are received at the EPO (Rule 56(2) or Rule 56(5)). The applicants are informed of the new filing date in a communication from the EPO. Within one month of this communication, they may withdraw the late-filed parts of the application (Rule 56(6)); if they do so, the redating of the application is deemed not to have taken place, any filing of missing parts of the description or missing drawings is deemed not to have occurred and all references to the missing parts of the description or missing drawings are deemed deleted (Rule 56(4)). The EPO will inform the applicants of this.

Where a reference to a missing figure, e.g. "see Fig. 4", is deemed deleted, then reference signs cited in it are also deemed deleted, although any technical information in the reference that is still technically meaningful without the reference may be retained: e.g. "see Fig. 4, a distillation column (1), provided with a condenser (2)" becomes "a distillation column provided with a condenser". The publication of the application (see A‑VI, 1.3) in such a case will contain the application documents as originally filed, without the references deleted.

If the late-filed missing parts of the application do not satisfy the physical requirements of Rule 49(2) in conjunction with the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 (OJ EPO 2022, A113), the EPO will not invite the applicant to correct this deficiency according to Rule 58 until the one-month period for withdrawing them has expired without the applicant having withdrawn them (see A‑III, 3.2.2).

Rule 56(2), (4) and (5)5.6 Additional fee for pages

For the calculation of the additional fee for pages in excess of 35 ("page fee"), see A‑III, 13.2.6. Correction of erroneously filed application documents or parts

6.1 Correction of erroneously filed application documents or parts – on invitation

6.2 Correction of erroneously filed application documents or parts – without invitation

6.3 The filing date changes

6.4 Correct application documents based on priority application, no change in the filing date

6.5 Withdrawal of correct application documents or parts

6.6 Same-day corrections

6.7 Correct application documents or parts filed after the search has started

6.8 Additional fee for pages

6.9 Claims fee6.1 Correction of erroneously filed application documents or parts – on invitation

The application is examined on filing to check that it is entitled to a filing date. If, during this check, the EPO establishes that the description, claims or drawings (or parts of them) appear to have been erroneously filed, it will invite the applicant to file the correct documents within a time limit of two months of a communication under Rules 56(1) and Rule 56a(1) (see A‑II, 5). During this time limit, the applicant may proceed under Rule 56a or Rule 56. If the applicant does not reply to this invitation in time, any filing of the correct application documents or parts will be deemed not to have occurred and the erroneously filed documents or parts will remain in the application as filed (Rule 56a(5)). It should be noted that the applicant may not invoke the omission of the communication under Rules 56(1) and Rule 56a(1) (see the notice from the EPO dated 23 June 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A71).

Rule 56a(1) Rule 56a(5)6.2 Correction of erroneously filed application documents or parts – without invitation

Applicants may also file correct (parts of) the description, claims or drawings on their own initiative (without being invited to do so by the EPO) within two months of the original filing date. If the applicant is invited by the EPO to file correct application documents or parts, the period under Rule 56a(1) takes precedence (see A‑II, 6.1).

If, within two months of the original filing date, applicants notice that they filed erroneous application documents or parts, they should, on their own initiative, file the correct ones as soon as possible under Rule 56a(3) because, in the absence of an EPO communication sent under Rules 56 and Rule 56a(1), the possibility for applicants to file any missing or correct parts ends two months after the original filing date.

Whether documents were erroneously filed depends only on the applicants' statement as to their intention. No further evidence is required by the EPO.

Rule 56a(3)

Further processing is ruled out for the time limits under Rule 56a(1) and Rule 56a(3) to Rule 56a(7) (Rule 135(2)).

Rule 135(2)6.3 The filing date changes

If, after the filing date, the applicant corrects the application documents (or parts) in accordance with the procedures explained in A‑II, 6.1 or A‑II, 6.2, then the erroneously filed documents will be deemed not to have been filed and the correct documents will be added to the application. The filing date changes to the date on which the EPO receives the correct parts. The applicant is informed of the new filing date under Rule 56a(3). This is subject to the exception explained in A‑II, 6.4.

Erroneously filed application documents remain in the file, even if they are considered not part of the application as filed. As such, following publication of the application, the erroneous application documents or parts are open to file inspection (see A‑XI, 2.1 and A‑XI, 2.3).6.4 Correct application documents based on priority application, no change in the filing date

If, after the filing date, the applicant corrects the application documents (or parts) in accordance with the procedures explained in A‑II, 6.1 or A‑II, 6.2, then the filing date does not change, provided that all of the following criteria are satisfied:

(i)the correct application documents (or parts) are filed within the applicable time limit*

(ii)the application claims priority on the date on which the requirements of Rule 40(1) were fulfilled (see A‑II, 4.1 and A‑II, 6.4.1)

(iii)the applicant requests that the correct application documents be based on the claimed priority (see A‑II, 6.4.1) to avoid a change in the filing date, and does so within the applicable time limit*

(iv)the correct application documents are completely contained in the priority application (see A‑II, 6.4.1)

(v)the applicant files a copy of the priority application within the applicable time limit* unless such a copy is already available to the EPO under Rule 53(2) (see A‑II, 6.4.2)

(vi)where the priority application is not in an official EPO language, the applicant files a translation into one such language within the applicable time limit* unless such a translation is already available to the EPO under Rule 53(3) (see A‑II, 6.4.3)

(vii)the applicant indicates where in the priority application and, if applicable, where in its translation, the correct application documents are completely contained, and does so within the applicable time limit* (see A‑II, 6.4.2).

For the applicable time limit, see whichever of A‑II, 6.1 or A‑II, 6.2 applies.

Where the conditions for including the correct application documents or parts under Rule 56a(4) are fulfilled, the date of filing remains unchanged. The correct application documents or parts are included in the application and the erroneously filed ones remain in the application as filed. The EPO informs the applicants of this in a communication under Rule 56a(4). The erroneously filed documents may only be removed by amending the application during the grant proceedings and subject to Art. 123(2).

Rule 56a(4)

Where criterion (i) is not satisfied, any filing of the correct application documents or parts is deemed not to have occurred. In this case, the filing date does not change and the erroneously filed application documents or parts remain in the application. The EPO will inform the applicant of this in accordance with Rule 56a(5).

Rule 56a(5)(a)

If the request according to Rule 56a(4) does not comply with one or more of criteria (ii)-(iv) above, then the date of filing will change to the date on which the EPO received the correct application documents or parts. They will be included in the application and the erroneously filed documents or parts will be deemed not to have been filed. The EPO will inform the applicant of this in accordance with Rule 56a(3).

Rule 56a(3)

If the request according to Rule 56a(4) does not comply with one or more of criteria (v)-(vii) above, then the filing date will change to the date on which the EPO received the correct application documents or parts and the erroneously filed ones will be deemed not to have been filed. The EPO will inform the applicant of this in accordance with Rule 56a(6).

Rule 56a(6)

6.4.1 Later-filed correct application documents or parts when priority is claimed

6.4.2 Copy of the priority application

6.4.3 Translation of the priority application6.4.1 Later-filed correct application documents or parts when priority is claimed

In the case of a request under Rule 56a(4), the EPO will check that the requirements for the priority claim are met (see A‑III, 6).

Where the applicant files a request under Rule 56a(4) (see A‑II, 6.4), the priority claim in question must have been in existence on the date on which the requirements laid down in Rule 40(1) were fulfilled (see A‑II, 4.1).

The requirement that the correct application documents or parts be completely contained in the priority application is the same as for missing parts of the description or missing drawings filed under Rule 56(3) (see A‑II, 5.4.2).

Final assessment of the "completely contained" requirement falls under the responsibility of the examining division (see C‑III, 1).

Rule 56a(4)6.4.2 Copy of the priority application

The same requirements apply as for missing parts of the description or missing drawings filed under Rule 56(3) (see A‑II, 5.4.3).6.4.3 Translation of the priority application

The same requirements apply as for missing parts of the description or missing drawings filed under Rule 56(3) (see A‑II, 5.4.4).6.5 Withdrawal of correct application documents or parts

Where applicants are informed about the new filing date, they may, within one month of the communication under Rule 56a(3) or Rule 56a(6) as applicable (see A‑II, 6.3 and A‑II, 6.4), withdraw the correct application documents or parts in order to maintain the initial date of filing. In this case, redating of the application and any filing of the correct documents or parts will be deemed not to have occurred. The erroneously filed documents or parts will be restored to the application as filed. The EPO will inform the applicants of this in accordance with Rule 56a(7).

Rule 56a(7)6.6 Same-day corrections

If applicants become aware that they filed incorrect application documents or parts and wish to file correct ones on or before the date the requirements of Rule 40(1) are fulfilled (see A‑II, 4.1), they can do so without needing to file a new application and pay the corresponding fees (Rule 56a(2)). The correct application documents or parts are included in the application and the erroneously filed ones are deemed not to have been filed. The EPO will inform the applicants of this in accordance with Rule 56a(2).

Rule 56a(2)6.7 Correct application documents or parts filed after the search has started

If applicants file correct application documents or parts after the EPO has already begun to draw up the search report, the EPO will invite them to pay a further search fee under Rule 56a(8) within a time limit of one month. If the fee is paid in time, the search will be completed on the basis of the filing date and the application documents established under the procedures described in A‑II, 6.3, A-II, 6.4 or A-II, 6.5. If the fee is not paid in time, the application will be deemed withdrawn (Rule 112(1)). Further processing is available (Rule 135(2)). Payment of the further search fee is excluded from automatic debiting (see Annex A.1 to the ADA, point 3(l)).

The requirements listed above and the procedure to be followed when they are not met are considered in the following sections.

Rule 302. Representation

2.1 Requirements

2.2 Non-compliance2.1 Requirements

The formalities officer must ensure that the requirements with regard to representation as set out in A‑VIII, 1 are met. The main points are:

(i)applicants who have neither a residence nor principal place of business in a contracting state must be represented by an authorised professional representative or by an authorised legal practitioner fulfilling the requirements of Art. 134(8)

Art. 133(2)

(ii)where an applicant having residence or principal place of business in a contracting state is represented by an employee, the employee is authorised

(iii)the authorisation, if any is required (see A‑VIII, 1.5 and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, L.1), must be in order, duly signed (see A‑VIII, 3.2 and A‑VIII, 3.4) and filed in due time.

Rule 1522.2 Non-compliance

The effect of non-compliance with the provisions concerning representation and the action to be taken by the formalities officer in dealing with any deficiency are considered in A‑III, 16.3. Physical requirements

3.1 General remarks

3.2 Documents making up the application, replacement documents, translations

3.3 Other documents3.1 General remarks

Every application that is subject to formal examination is examined for compliance with the requirements as to form set out below. Non-compliance with the requirements is considered in A‑III, 16.

Art. 90(3)3.2 Documents making up the application, replacement documents, translations

The Receiving Section must ensure that the documents making up the application, i.e. request, description, claims, drawings and abstract, meet the requirements of Rule 49(2) in conjunction with Art. 4(2) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 (OJ EPO 2022, A113) to the extent necessary for satisfactory reproduction and reasonably uniform publication of the application under Rule 68(1). This equally applies to any supplementary document filed as an appendix to the description. When evaluating the quality of the application documents and their suitability for electronic and direct reproduction, the Receiving Section's objective must be to ascertain the discernibility of all details originally disclosed in the documents received on the date of filing. The Receiving Section should not, however, draw the applicant's attention to any deficiencies in the content of the application, namely those listed in Art. 1(2)(i) and Art. 1(2)(j) and Art. 2(8), fourth sentence, of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 (see also the notice from the EPO dated 25 November 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A114, point 8, and A‑III, 16.1).

In the case of requirements that may necessitate some technical knowledge, such as those of Art. 1(2)(f) and Art. 1(2)(h) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, the Receiving Section should, if in doubt, consult and take the advice of the search division. It should also consider taking action when the search division identifies a deficiency previously overlooked. It should be noted that flow sheets and diagrams are to be considered as drawings (Art. 1(3) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022).

If the formal requirements of Rule 49(2) are not met, the applicant is invited to remedy this deficiency within a non-extendable two-month period (Rule 58 and Rule 50(1)). If it is not remedied in time, the application is refused (Art. 90(5)).

Once the examining division assumes responsibility for the application, it also becomes responsible for formal matters. It should pay particular attention to the more technical requirements, in particular those laid down in Art. 1(2)(i) and Art. 1(2)(j), Art. 2(8), fourth sentence, and Art. 2(9) and Art. 2(10) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 (see also the notice from the EPO dated 25 November 2022, point 8).

Rule 10 Art. 94(1)

Replacement documents, including the amendment of granted patents (Rule 86), and translations in an official language of documents filed under the provisions of Art. 14(2) or Art. 14(4) are subject to the same requirements as the documents making up the application. They must therefore be typed or printed. Submissions containing handwritten amendments to application or patent specification documents are formally deficient and need to be corrected (see OJ EPO 2013, 603; however, see also E‑III, 8.7 and OJ EPO 2016, A22, as well as H‑III, 2.2).

In examination proceedings the invitation to correct formal deficiencies is sent by the formalities officer on behalf of the examining division (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 December 2013, OJ EPO 2014, A6).

With regard to sequence listings, see A‑IV, 5.

In the event of deficiencies under Rule 30, the Receiving Section must invite the applicant to remedy them within a non-extendable two-month period. If they are not remedied in time, the application is refused by the Receiving Section under Rule 30(3) (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 December 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A96, and the notice from the EPO dated 9 December 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A97; see also A‑IV, 5).

The particular requirements for drawings are dealt with in A‑IX.

3.2.1 Physical requirements of applications filed by reference to a previously filed application

3.2.2 Physical requirements of late-filed application documents or correct application documents or parts3.2.1 Physical requirements of applications filed by reference to a previously filed application

If the application is filed by reference to a previously filed application under Rule 40(1)(c) (see A‑II, 4.1.3.1), and if no translation is required, the certified copy of the previously filed application required under Rule 40(3) must satisfy the physical requirements. If the previously filed application is not in an official EPO language, only the translation under Rule 40(3) must satisfy the physical requirements (Rule 49(2)), provided that the authenticity of the contents of the original is not impugned.3.2.2 Physical requirements of late-filed application documents or correct application documents or parts

Where claims are filed after the filing date (see A‑III, 15) or where missing parts of the description, missing drawings or correct application documents or parts are inserted after the filing date (see A‑II, 5 and A‑II, 6), all of these late-filed application documents must also satisfy the physical requirements. Consequently, the EPO will carry out two separate checks, first on the physical requirements of the original application documents, and second on any late-filed application documents. Any deficiencies will be communicated only when the complete application documents are on file.

If the late filing of missing parts of the description, missing drawings or correct application documents or parts results in a change of the filing date, the applicant can withdraw the late-filed parts of the description or drawings up to one month after being notified of the change in filing date (Rule 56(6)). Similarly, they can withdraw correct application documents or parts filed under Rule 56a within the same period (Rule 56a(7)). Consequently, if the late-filed missing parts of the description, missing drawings or correct application documents or parts:

(i)contain deficiencies with regard to the physical requirements and

(ii)result in a change of the filing date,

the EPO will wait until the one-month period for their withdrawal has expired and will then send a communication according to Rule 58 in respect of these deficiencies, if the applicant has not withdrawn them in time.3.3 Other documents

All documents other than those making up the application must be typewritten or printed with a left margin of about 2.5 cm on each page (Art. 3 of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A113).

Rule 50(2)4. Request for grant

4.1 General remarks

4.2 Examination of the request for grant form4.1 General remarks

The request for grant must be made on the appropriate EPO form (EPO Form 1001), even though the request (the indication that a patent is sought, referred to in A‑II, 4.1(i)) need initially be in no particular form. The latest version of EPO Form 1001 can be accessed in EPO Online Filing and Online Filing 2.0 the EPO's online filing tools or downloaded from the EPO website (epo.org) (see A‑II, 1.2.2 A‑II, 1.1.1).

For filing with EPO Online Filing, applicants should always use the latest version of the EPO Online Filing software (see A‑II, 1.1.1(i) A‑II, 1.2.2 (i)) or and, for paper filings and filings made with the EPO web-form filing service and the EPO Contingency Upload Service, the latest version of the form.

Rule 41(1)4.2 Examination of the request for grant form

The Receiving Section examines the request form to ensure that it contains the information listed in Rule 41(2), including the integral petition for grant (Rule 41(2)(a)). The applicant must be allowed to correct deficiencies in the request to the extent indicated in A‑III, 16.

4.2.3 Further requirements laid down by Rule 41(2)4.2.1 Information on the applicant

As specified in Rule 41(2)(c), the request must contain the name, address and nationality of the applicant and the state in which that party's residence or principal place of business is located. Where the application is filed by more than one applicant, the requirement must be satisfied for each applicant. At this stage in the proceedings, the formalities officer will consider the person named as applicant's entitlement to apply for a patent (A‑II, 2).

Applicants (whether natural or legal persons) whose residence or principal place of business is in an EPC contracting state and who act without a professional representative can use an address for correspondence other than their residence. It must be the applicant's own address and be in an EPC contracting state. For the address to be used in proceedings before the EPO applicants must explicitly inform the EPO that it is to be used for correspondence, preferably by entering it in the box marked "Address for correspondence" on EPO Form 1001 (see the notice from the EPO dated 4 September 2014, OJ EPO 2014, A99). Post Correspondence cannot be sent to a different (natural or legal) person, since that requires a valid form of representation under Art. 133 and Art. 134.4.2.2 Signature

The request must be signed by the applicant or the appointed representative. If there is more than one applicant, each applicant or their appointed representative must sign the request. For further details as to the signature of the request, see A‑VIII, 3.2 to A-VIII, 3.4.

Rule 41(2)(h)4.2.3 Further requirements laid down by Rule 41(2)

The provisions of Rule 41(2)(b), Rule 41(2)(e), Rule 41(2)(f) and Rule 41(2)(g), dealing respectively with the title of the invention, divisional applications, Art. 61 applications and claim to priority, are considered in subsequent sections of this chapter and in A‑IV.5. Designation of inventor

5.1 General remarks

5.2 Waiver of right to be mentioned as inventor

5.3 Designation filed in a separate document

5.4 Deficiencies

5.5 Incorrect designation5.1 General remarks

Every application must designate the inventor, who must be a natural person with legal capacity (J 8/20). The designation is incorporated in the EPO's online filing tools (see A‑II, 1.3) EPO Online Filing and Online Filing 2.0 (see A‑II, 1.1.1). When filing on paper, or in the EPO web-form filing service or the EPO Contingency Upload Service, the designation is filed on a separate document where the applicant is not the inventor or the sole inventor. Where that is not the case, the designation must be effected on the request for grant form (EPO Form 1001) by selecting the appropriate box in section 22. Where the designation is effected on a separate document, a trilingual form – EPO Form 1002 – available on the EPO website should preferably be used.

Art. 81 Rule 19 Rule 41(2)(j)5.2 Waiver of right to be mentioned as inventor

Inventors designated by the applicant may send the EPO a written waiver of their right to be mentioned as inventor in the published European patent application and the European patent specification. If it is received in time, their name is not mentioned in the published European patent application, the European patent specification, the European Patent Register (Rule 143(1)(g)) and, consequently, the European Patent Bulletin. Moreover, in accordance with Rule 144(c), the designation of the inventor as well as the waiver is then excluded from file inspection under Art. 128(4). If the waiver is received after the publication of the European patent application, the mention of the inventor will be removed in the European Patent Register.

Rule 20(1) Rule 143(1)(g) Rule 144(c) Art. 129(a)5.3 Designation filed in a separate document

Where filed in a separate document, the designation must contain the inventor's family name, given names and country and place of residence. The place of residence is the city or municipality, i.e. not the province or region, where the inventor permanently resides and should preferably include the postal code (see the notice from the EPO dated 22 February 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A12). The country and place of residence may also be that of the inventor's employer (e.g. a company). The designation must contain the statement, referred to in Art. 81, indicating the origin of the right to the patent and the signature of the applicant or the appointed representative.

In the case of assignment, the words "by agreement dated ..." suffice. For inventions by employees, it is sufficient to mention that the inventor(s) is/are employee(s) of the applicant(s) and for cases of succession that the applicant(s) is/are heir(s) of the inventor(s).

The designation of inventor must be signed by the applicant or the appointed representative. With regard to the signature, the provisions set out in A‑VIII, 3.2 to A‑VIII, 3.4, apply.

Rule 19(1)

The EPO does not verify the accuracy of the information given in the designation of the inventor but checks whether the designated inventor is a natural person (J 8/20).

If the designation of inventor is filed subsequently, the requirements set out in A‑VIII, 3.1 apply.

Rule 19(2)5.4 Deficiencies

Where a designation is not filed or cannot be considered validly filed due to a deficiency (e.g. inventor's name / country / place of residence / applicant's signature is missing), the applicant is informed that the European patent application will be refused if the deficiency is not remedied within the period prescribed under Rule 60(1), i.e. within 16 months of the filing date or, if priority is claimed, of the priority date. This time limit is deemed met if the information is communicated before completion of the technical preparations for publication (see A‑VI, 1.2). For divisional applications, see A‑IV, 1.5. Where the applicant has requested early publication and, accordingly, technical preparations for publication are completed before expiry of the 16-month time limit, the applicant can still file the designation within that time limit (see J 1/10). If the deficiency is not remedied in time, the application is refused and the applicant is notified accordingly. Further processing is possible according to Art. 121 and Rule 135 (see E‑VIII, 2).

Art. 90(3) to Art. 90(5) Art. 93(1) Rule 60(1) Art. 1215.5 Incorrect designation

An incorrect designation may be rectified, provided that a request is received together with the consent of the wrongly designated person and that of the patent's applicant or proprietor where the request is not filed by that party. If a further inventor is to be designated, the consent of the inventor(s) previously designated is not necessary (see J 8/82). The provisions of A‑III, 5.3 apply to the corrected designation mutatis mutandis. Rectification may also be requested after the proceedings before the EPO are terminated.

Rule 21(1)

Where an incorrect designation has been rectified and where the incorrect designation was recorded in the European Patent Register or published in the European Patent Bulletin, its rectification or cancellation will also be recorded or published there. Rectification of the designation of an inventor falls under the responsibility of the Legal Division (see the decisions of the President of the EPO dated 21 November 2013, OJ EPO 2013, 600 and OJ EPO 2013, 601).

6.11 Notification

6.12 Copy of the search results for the priority or priorities6.1 General remarks

A European patent applicant is entitled to – and may claim – the priority of an earlier first application where:

(i)the previous application was filed in or for a state or WTO member recognised as giving rise to a priority right in accordance with the provisions of the EPC (see also A‑III, 6.2)

(ii)the European patent applicant was the applicant who made the previous application or is their successor in title

(iii)the European patent application is made during a period of twelve months from the previous application's filing date (see, however, A‑III, 6.6) and

(iv)the European patent application concerns the same invention as the invention disclosed in the previous application (see also A‑III, 6.4 and F‑VI, 1), which must be the "first application" (see F‑VI, 1.4 and 1.4.1).

As concerns (i), the previous application may be an application for a patent, the registration of a utility model or a utility certificate. However, a priority right based on the deposit of an industrial design is not recognised (see J 15/80).

Art. 87(1), Art. 87(2) and Art. 87(5)

So long as the contents of the previous application were sufficient to establish a filing date, that date can be used to determine a priority date, irrespective of the outcome (e.g. subsequent withdrawal or refusal) of the application.

As concerns (ii), it is important to note that the transfer of the application including the priority right is distinct from a possible transfer of the priority application and (or of the priority right as such) must have taken place before the filing date of the later European patent application and must be assessed valid under the EPC, regardless of any national laws relevant national provisions. The EPC does not set out any formal requirements for the transfer of the priority right (see G 1/22 and G 2/22). Where the previous application was filed by joint applicants, all of them must be among the later European patent application's applicants or have transferred their rights in the priority application to the later European patent application's applicant (see T 844/18). Proof of the transfer can be filed later. Yet, absent any substantiated indication to the contrary, there is a strong rebuttable presumption under the EPC that an applicant or joint applicants claiming priority in accordance with Art. 88(1) and Rule 52 are also entitled to the claimed priority. The burden of proof is shifted, and the examining division, opponent or third party challenging an applicant's entitlement to priority has to prove that this entitlement is missing. Especially where an international application under the PCT is filed by joint applicants, including the priority applicant, but without naming the priority applicant as applicant for the European designation, the mere fact of the joint filing implies an agreement between the applicants allowing all of them to rely on the priority right unless substantial facts indicate otherwise (see G 1/22 and G 2/22).

However, in the case of joint applicants filing the later European patent application, it is sufficient if one of the applicants is the previous application's applicant or their successor in title. There is no need for a special transfer of the priority right to the other applicant(s), since the later European patent application has been filed jointly. The same applies where the previous application itself was filed by joint applicants, provided that all of them, or their successor(s) in title, are among the later European patent application's joint applicants.

As concerns (iii), the priority period starts on the day following the first application's filing date (Art. 4C(2) Paris Convention and Rule 131(2)). Accordingly, where a priority claim relates to an application filed on the same day as the European patent application, it will be disregarded (see, however, also A‑III, 6.6).

Art. 87(3)6.2 Applications giving rise to a right of priority

Applications giving rise to a right of priority referred to in A‑III, 6.1(i) are those filed at industrial property offices:

(a)of or acting for states party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property

Art. 87(1)

(b)of or acting for any member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or

Art. 87(1)

(c)not subject to either the Paris Convention or the Agreement establishing the WTO, but where:

(i)that authority recognises that a first filing made at the EPO gives rise to a right of priority under conditions and with effects equivalent to those laid down in the Paris Convention and

(ii)the EPO President issues a communication indicating this.

To date, no such communication referred to in (c)(ii) has been issued and so this does not as yet apply. Furthermore, the members of the WTO do not necessarily have to be states as such but may also be intergovernmental bodies or regions with special status such as the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.

In view of the wording of Art. 87(1), which refers to filings "in or for" any state party to the Paris Convention or member of the WTO, priority may be claimed of an earlier first-filed national application, a previous European patent application, a previous application filed under another regional patent treaty or an international application filed under the PCT. This includes the US "provisional application for patent" (notice from the EPO President dated 26 January 1996, OJ EPO 1996, 81). A list of the countries party to the Paris Convention is available on WIPO's website and regularly published in the EPO Official Journal. Likewise, a list of the members of the WTO is regularly updated on the WTO website.

The possibility previously excluded by decisions G 2/02 and G 3/02 of claiming priority from an application filed at the industrial property authority of a WTO member not party to the Paris Convention (Art. 87(1) EPC 1973) no longer applies under the revised Art. 87(1).

Art. 87(5)6.3 Multiple priorities

The applicant may claim more than one priority based on previous applications in the same or different states and/or WTO members. Where multiple priorities are claimed, time limits calculated from the priority date run from the earliest date of priority and, as a result, the European patent application must be made within twelve months of the earliest priority date (see, however, A‑III, 6.6); this applies if earlier applications have been filed in any of the industrial property offices mentioned in A‑III, 6.2.

Art. 88(2)6.4 Examination of the priority document

The Receiving Section is not required to examine the content of the priority document. However, where it is obvious, e.g. from the title of the document, that the document concerns subject-matter quite different from that of the application, the applicant should be informed that that the document filed might not be relevant.6.5 Declaration of priority

An applicant wishing to claim priority must file a declaration of priority indicating:

(i)the date of the previous application

(ii)the state or WTO member in or for which it was filed

(iii)its file number.

The declaration of priority should preferably be made on filing the European patent application (Rule 52(2)). In such a case the declaration of priority, indicating at least the date on which and the country for which the earlier application was filed, should be included on the request for grant form (Rule 41(2)(g)). However, if a priority claim is added or corrected after the request for grant form has been filed (see A‑III, 6.5.1 and A-III, 6.5.2), the applicant will not be invited by the EPO to file a corrected request for grant.

The time limit for filing the certified copy of the priority document is the same as for making the priority claim (see A‑III, 6.5.1 and A-III, 6.7). Consequently, where:

(a)the applicant supplies the certified copy on time and

(b)the date and file number are indicated on the certified copy

the requirements of Rule 52(1) are met.

Art. 88(1) Rule 52(1) Rule 41(2)(g) Art. 90(4)

6.5.1 Filing a new priority claim

6.5.2 Correcting an existing priority claim

6.5.3 Deficiencies in the priority claim and loss of the priority right6.5.1 Filing a new priority claim

The declaration of priority should preferably be made on filing but can be made up to 16 months from the earliest priority date claimed. That is to say, items (i)-(iii) mentioned in A‑III, 6.5 can be supplied up to 16 months after the earliest claimed priority date. Where the priority claim is inserted after the filing date and causes a change in the earliest priority date, this 16-month period is calculated from that new earliest priority date in accordance with Art. 88(2). A priority claim inserted after the filing date cannot be used in support of a request made under Rule 56(3) or Rule 56a(4) (see A‑II, 5.4 and A‑II, 6.4).

The applicant cannot request further processing in respect of the time limit for introducing a new priority claim under Rule 52(2), since it is ruled out by Rule 135(2).

Rule 52(2)6.5.2 Correcting an existing priority claim

The applicant may correct the declaration of priority within 16 months of the earliest priority date. Where the correction causes a change in the earliest claimed priority date, this time limit is the earlier to expire of:

(i)16 months from the earliest priority date as originally claimed or

(ii)16 months from the earliest priority date as corrected.

However, this time limit cannot expire earlier than four months after the date of filing. Thus, if the originally claimed priority date is incorrect and precedes the date of filing by more than twelve months, the applicants will always have at least four months to correct this date, i.e. the same period as if they had claimed the correct priority date (and for example got the file number wrong) and claimed a full twelve-month priority period.

If the applicant files a request for correction later it may, exceptionally, be allowed if it is apparent from the published application that a mistake was made (see A‑V, 3 and other sources mentioned there).

Rule 52(3)6.5.3 Deficiencies in the priority claim and loss of the priority right

Four potential deficiencies exist with regard to the priority claim, namely:

(i)failure to indicate a date of the previous application or to indicate the correct date

(ii)failure to indicate a state or WTO member in or for which it was filed or to indicate the correct state or WTO member

(iii)failure to supply a file number

(iv)failure to indicate the correct file number.

Deficiencies (i) and (ii) can only be corrected in accordance with the procedures and within the time limit indicated in A‑III, 6.5.2. Failure to correct either of these deficiencies in time results in loss of the priority right in question according to Art. 90(5). Further processing does not apply to the time limit under Rule 52(3), since it is ruled out by Rule 135(2).

Art. 90(4) and Art. 90(5)

However, where applicants have failed to indicate the file number of the previous application (deficiency (iii)), as required by Rule 52(1), before expiry of the 16-month time limit laid down in Rule 52(2), they are invited by the EPO to provide it within a two-month period under Rule 59. This period can be extended under Rule 132(2) (see E‑IX, 2.3.5 for Euro-PCT applications), but further processing is ruled out by Rule 135(2). Failure to reply in time to this communication results in the loss of the priority right in question according to Art. 90(5).

If the applicant has failed to indicate the correct file number of the priority application (deficiency (iv)), a request for correction under Rule 139 can be filed (see A‑V, 3).

Art. 90(4) and (5) Rule 596.6 Priority period

Where a priority claim's date precedes the European patent application's filing date by more than twelve months, the applicant may be informed by the Receiving Section that their priority claim is considered invalid unless they:

(i)indicate a corrected date lying within the twelve-month period preceding the filing date and do so within the time limit according to Rule 52(3) (see A‑III, 6.5.2) or

(ii)request re-establishment of rights in respect of the priority period and do so within two months of the expiry of the priority period, and this request is subsequently granted (see paragraph below). This only applies where the applicant also filed the European patent application within the same two-month period.

Where priority is claimed from an application having the same filing date as the European patent application (see A‑III, 6.1), the EPO will inform the applicant that priority cannot be claimed from this application unless the priority date can be corrected (see A‑III, 6.5.2).

Rules 133 and Rule 134 apply to the priority period under Art. 87(1). If the date indicated for the previous application is subsequent to or the same as the filing date, the procedure set out in A‑III, 6.5.2 also applies (with regard to the possibility of correcting clerical or similar errors, see A‑V, 3).

According to Art. 122 and Rule 136(1) re-establishment of rights in respect of the priority period (twelve months according to Art. 87(1)) is possible. The request for re-establishment must be filed within two months of expiry of the priority period (Rule 136(1)) and the omitted act, i.e. the establishment of a filing date for the European patent application, must also be completed in this period (Rule 136(2)). For more details on requesting re-establishment of rights, see E‑VIII, 3.

Art. 122 Rule 133 Rule 134 Rule 1366.7 Copy of the previous application (priority document)

A copy of the previous application from which priority is claimed (priority document) must be filed before the end of the 16th month after the priority date. Priority documents may be filed in paper form or electronically using OLF EPO Online Filing or Online Filing 2.0, provided the latter are in an accepted document format, have been digitally signed by the issuing authority and the signature is accepted by the EPO. Such electronic priority documents are currently being issued by the patent offices of Austria, Brazil, Czech Republic, Greece, Italy, France, Poland, Portugal, Singapore and the USA, Brazil, Portugal, Italy, Austria, France and Poland, with further offices expected to follow. Priority documents may not be filed using the EPO web-form filing service or the EPO Contingency Upload Service (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 May 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A42 3 May 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A48) or by fax (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 20 February 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A18). Where multiple priorities are claimed, the above time limit runs from the earliest date of priority.

The copy and the filing date of the previous application must be certified as correct by the authority with which the previous application was filed. Certification of the date may take the form of a separate certificate issued by that authority stating the filing date of the previous application (Rule 53(1), second sentence) or may be an integral part of the priority document itself. The certification of the copy's authenticity may also be a separate document or an integral part of the priority document.

A copy of the previous application (priority document) can also be filed on physical media other than paper, e.g. CD-R disc, provided that:

(a)the physical medium containing the priority document is prepared by the authority with which the previous application was filed and comes with the guarantee that its content cannot undetectably be altered subsequently

(b)the content of the physical medium is certified by that authority as an exact copy of (parts of) the previous application and

(c)the filing date of the previous application is also certified by that authority.

The certificate(s) may be filed separately on paper. The physical medium must be readable and free of computer viruses and other forms of malicious logic.

Rule 53(1) Art. 88(2) Art. 90(4)

At the request of the applicant, the EPO will include free of charge in the file of a European patent application a copy of the previous application from which priority is claimed retrieved via the WIPO Digital Access Service (DAS). DAS permits the automatic electronic exchange of priority documents between participating patent offices. Applicants may request the office of first filing (OFF) to make certified copies of previously filed patent applications available to DAS and then request offices of second filing (OSF) to retrieve the copies via DAS by indicating the DAS access code(s) corresponding to the previous application(s) (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 13 November 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A83, and the notice from the EPO dated 22 February 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A27).

If a priority document cannot be retrieved via DAS or if the applicant has not requested retrieval via DAS, the EPO will include free of charge a copy of the previous application in the file of the European patent application, if the previous application is:

(i)a European patent application

(ii)an international application filed with the EPO as receiving Office under the PCT.

No request is necessary for this. If the previous application is a Chinese, Korean or United States application, the EPO will only include a copy of the previous application free of charge if the European patent application was filed before 1 January 2022 or, in the case of a Euro-PCT application that entered the European phase before that date, if the required priority document can be included in the application's file by 30 June 2023 (see the notice from the EPO dated 13 November 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A84). If the language of the previous application was not one of the official EPO languages, it may still be necessary to file the translation or declaration under Rule 53(3) (see A‑III, 6.8).

Where the applicant has already supplied a copy of the priority document in connection with a request to base late-filed parts of the description or drawings on the claimed priority under Rule 56 (see A‑II, 5.4(v)) or to base correct application documents or parts on the claimed priority under Rule 56a (see A‑II, 6.4(v)), there is no need to file it again. However, if the copy already provided was not certified as to its content and/or filing date, the applicant will need to provide the missing certification within the above time limit.

Rule 53(2)

If applicants fail to provide a certified copy of the priority document within the above-mentioned period (Rule 53(1)), the EPO will invite them to provide it within a two-month period under Rule 59. This period can be extended under Rule 132(2) (see E‑IX, 2.3.5 for Euro-PCT applications), but further processing is ruled out by Rule 135(2). If the applicant fails to provide it within this period, the priority right in question is lost (Art. 90(5)).

A copy of the previous application that cannot be included in the file will not be deemed duly filed under Rule 53(2). The EPO will inform applicants in good time and give them an opportunity to file the certified copy in accordance with Rule 53(1) (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 13 November 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A83, and the notice from the EPO dated 13 November 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A84).

Art. 90(4) and Art. 90(5) Rule 596.8 Translation of the previous application

Where the previous application claimed as priority is not in an official EPO language and the validity of the priority claimed is relevant for assessing the patentability of the invention concerned, the EPO will invite the applicant for or proprietor of the European patent to file a translation into an official EPO language within a period specified. The duration of this period will vary depending on the stage of proceedings at which the invitation is sent (see the subsequent subsections).

Art. 88(1) Rule 53(3)

6.8.1 Invitation to file the translation before examination

6.8.2 Invitation to file the translation in examination/opposition

6.8.3 Loss of rights and legal remedies

6.8.4 Translation of previous application already filed

6.8.5 Voluntary filing of the translation of the previous application

6.8.6 Declaration replacing the translation6.8.1 Invitation to file the translation before examination

Where the search division notes that a translation of the previous application is required, the invitation to provide it according to Rule 53(3) may be sent at the same time as either item (i) or item (ii) below:

(i)the communication according to Rule 69(1) and Rule 70a(1) (where the applicant does not file the request for examination before the search report is transmitted – see A‑VI, 2.1).

In this case, the time limit for providing the translation is the same as for filing the request for examination, i.e. six months from the date of mention of the publication of the European search report according to Rule 70(1).

(ii)the communication according to Rule 70(2) (where the applicant files the request for examination before the (supplementary) European search report is transmitted – see A‑VI, 2.3).

In this case the time limit for providing the translation is the same as for filing the confirmation of the request for examination according to Rule 70(2):

(a)for applications not filed via the PCT, this is six months from the date of mention of the publication of the European search report (see A‑VI, 2.3).

(b)for Euro-PCT applications subject to the preparation of a supplementary European search report (see B‑II, 4.3.2), this is six months from the notification of the communication according to Rule 70(2) (see E‑IX, 2.5.3).

In practice, the invitation according to Rule 53(3) will be sent to the applicant in a separate communication and, in some cases, might not be dispatched on exactly the same date as the applicable communication indicated in (i) or (ii) above. However, this will not affect the expiry date of the period for providing the translation, since the relevant event used in its calculation (the mention of the publication of the European search report or the notification of the communication under Rule 70(2)) is not related to the notification of the invitation according to Rule 53(3). An exception applies where the communication under Rule 53(3) is notified less than two months before expiry of the resulting period; in that case the time limit for filing the translation will be considered extended until two months after the notification of the invitation, without prejudice to its possible extension under Rule 132(2) (see E‑VIII, 1.6).6.8.2 Invitation to file the translation in examination/opposition

The period set under Rule 132(2) for providing the translation in either examination or opposition proceedings is four months.

If not sent earlier (see A‑III, 6.8.1), an invitation according to Rule 53(3) may be sent in examination proceedings either alone or as an annex to a communication according to Art. 94(3). When sent as an annex to a communication according to Art. 94(3), the time limit set for reply to that communication is the same as for providing the translation (i.e. four months), even where the issues raised in the communication are minor (see E‑VIII, 1.2).

For Euro-PCT applications where the EPO acted as the ISA or the Supplementary International Searching Authority (SISA, Rule 45bis PCT), an invitation according to Rule 53(3) may be sent by the examining division only after the period according to Rule 161(1) has expired (see E‑IX, 3.2).

Since the proprietor of a European patent might not have previously been invited to file a translation (in the examination procedure or earlier as indicated in A‑III, 6.8.1) in cases where the validity of the claimed priority becomes relevant for assessing patentability in opposition proceedings, the EPO may make the above invitation during the opposition procedure.

In examination and opposition proceedings, where the applicant or proprietor has been invited to provide the translation, no summons to oral proceedings will be sent until either the translation is provided or (in examination proceedings) the period for further processing in respect of the time limit according to Rule 53(3) has expired, whichever is the earlier.

In practice, the search, examining or opposition division dealing with the patent application or patent will inform the formalities officer that a translation of the previous application is required and the formalities officer will then dispatch the above communication.

Rule 132(2)6.8.3 Loss of rights and legal remedies

If the applicant for or proprietor of the European patent does not provide the translation in time, the right of priority is lost and the applicant or proprietor is informed accordingly (see A‑III, 6.11). This has the effect that the intermediate document(s) will become prior art under Art. 54(2) or Art. 54(3), as applicable, and therefore relevant for the assessment of patentability. There is no further invitation to the applicant or proprietor to file the translation. However, in examination proceedings, further processing is available in cases of failure to file the translation in time (see E‑VIII, 2). Where appropriate, the applicant can also request a decision under Rule 112(2) (see E‑VIII, 1.9.3).

Where translations of more than one previous application are requested and not provided in time, one further processing fee is due according to Rule 135(1) and Art. 2(1), item 12, RFees for each of these priorities. This applies even where the translations were requested in a single Rule 53(3) invitation.

In the event of failure to file the translation in time in opposition proceedings, the proprietor can request re-establishment of rights according to Art. 122 and Rule 136 (see E‑VIII, 3). Further processing is not available to the patent proprietor in opposition proceedings. A decision according to Rule 112(2) may, however, be requested, if applicable (see E‑VIII, 1.9.3).6.8.4 Translation of previous application already filed

Where the applicant has already supplied a translation of the previous application in connection with a request to base late-filed parts of the description or drawings on the claimed priority under Rule 56 (see A‑II, 5.4(vi)) or to base correct application documents or parts on the claimed priority under Rule 56a (see A‑II, 6.4(vi)), the applicant does not need to file it again.6.8.5 Voluntary filing of the translation of the previous application

Applicants for or proprietors of the European patent can file a translation of the previous application on their own initiative at any time during examination or opposition proceedings before the EPO.6.8.6 Declaration replacing the translation

Alternatively, a declaration that the European patent application is a complete translation of the previous application may be submitted within those same time limits (see also F‑VI, 3.4 and D‑VII, 2). The declaration may also be made by selecting the appropriate box on the request for grant form (EPO Form 1001). This declaration is only valid if the text of the European patent application as filed is an exact translation of the previous application of which priority is claimed, i.e. with nothing added or omitted. If the European patent application did not contain claims on the filing date (see A‑II, 4.1), the applicant can file these later (see A‑III, 15). In such cases, for the declaration to be valid, the description of the European patent application must be an exact translation of the description of the claimed priority, regardless of whether the latter contained claims on its filing date. However, where the European patent application contains claims on its filing date and the previous application did not or contained fewer claims on its filing date, the declaration is not valid. Furthermore, if the European patent application contains more or less text than is contained in the previous application as filed, such a declaration cannot be accepted. Where the declaration cannot be accepted for any of the above reasons, to comply with the requirement for filing a translation, a complete translation must be filed within the set time limit. A declaration's validity is not affected by the simple rearrangement of its various parts (i.e. the claims vs. the description) (e.g. if the claims are presented at the end of the application, whereas in the previous application they are at the beginning) or by the use of a different type of reference sign (e.g. Arabic rather than Roman numerals). However, a declaration is not acceptable if changes have been made within the parts of the application (e.g. different order of claims, added reference signs) or if sections of the application (e.g. listing of components, section headings and words in the drawings) are not identical to those in the previous application.

Where a European patent application claims multiple priorities, the declaration will only in exceptional cases be a translation of the full text of one of the previous applications. In such cases, it may be filed in respect of the identical previous application, while a complete translation of the other previous application(s) will have to be filed on request.6.9 Non-entitlement to right to priority

A European patent application has no right to priority if:

(i)the application was not filed within the twelve-month period referred to in A‑III, 6.1(iii) and the applicant has neither:

(a)corrected the priority date on time (see A‑III, 6.5.2) such that the European patent application's filing date no longer exceeds the twelve-month priority period under Art. 87(1) or the priority date is no longer the same as the filing date (see A‑III, 6.6), nor

(b)successfully requested re-establishment of rights in respect of the priority claim (see A‑III, 6.6)

Art. 87(1)

(ii)the previous application did not seek an industrial property right giving rise to a priority right (see A‑III, 6.1) or

Art. 87(1)

(iii)the previous application does not give rise to a priority right in respect of the state, WTO member or industrial property authority in or for which it was filed (see A‑III, 6.1(i) and A-III, 6.2).

Art. 87(1) and Art. 87(4)6.10 Loss of right to priority

The right to priority for a European patent application is lost where:

(i)the declaration of priority is not filed in due time (see A‑III, 6.5.1)

(ii)the declaration of priority is not corrected in due time (see A‑III, 6.5.2 and A-III, 6.5.3)

(iii)the certified copy of the previous application is not filed in due time (see A‑III, 6.7)

(iv)the translation of the previous application or the declaration referred to in A‑III, 6.8.6 is not filed in due time in response to an invitation according to Rule 53(3) (see A‑III, 6.8.3).

Art. 90(4) and Art. 90(5) Rule 53(3)6.11 Notification

The applicant is notified of any non-entitlement to or loss of a priority right. The computation of time limits that depend on the priority will take this new situation into account. This also applies where entitlement to a priority right is surrendered. The termination of a priority right has no effect on a time limit that has already expired (see also F‑VI, 3.4 and E‑VIII, 1.5). If the search has not yet been carried out, the Receiving Section notifies the search division of a loss of or non-entitlement to a priority date.

Rule 112(1)6.12 Copy of the search results for the priority or priorities

An applicant claiming priority within the meaning of Art. 87 must file a copy of the results of any search carried out by the authority with which the previous application was filed together with the European patent application either without delay after receiving such results or, in the case of a Euro-PCT application, on entry into the European phase. This requirement also applies to priority claims that are subsequently withdrawn or lapse and to priority claims introduced or corrected after the filing date (see A‑III, 6.5.1 and A‑III, 6.5.2). The obligation under Rule 141(1) exists as long as the application is pending before the EPO and applies to all European and Euro-PCT applications filed on or after 1 January 2011 (OJ EPO 2009, 585). In the case of divisional applications, the relevant date is that on which the divisional application was received by the EPO (see A‑IV, 1.2.1), not the filing date of the parent application. Where the copy is not provided to the EPO before the examining division assumes responsibility, the procedure is as set out in C‑II, 5 and C‑III, 6.

Where multiple priorities are claimed, the copy of the search results referred to above must be provided for all applications claimed as priority. If the search results are not drawn up in an official EPO language, no translation is required. The copy of the search results submitted must be a copy of the official document issued by the office where the previous application was filed. A simple listing of the prior art drawn up by the applicant will not suffice. Copies of the cited documents do not have to be provided (see the notice from the EPO dated 28 July 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 410).

Rule 141(1)

The copy referred to in Rule 141(1) is deemed duly filed if it is available to the EPO and is to be included in the European patent application's file under the conditions determined by the EPO President. According to the decision of the President of the EPO dated 5 October 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 600, these exceptions relate to cases where a search report of the following type was drawn up by the EPO on an application whose priority is claimed:

(i)European search report (Art. 92)

(ii)international search report (Art. 15(1) PCT)

(iii)international-type search report (Art. 15(5) PCT)

(iv)search report prepared on behalf of a national office on a national application. As at October 2021, the EPO performs searches for the national offices of Albania, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, San Marino, United Kingdom.

The EPO also includes a copy of the search results referred to in Rule 141(1) in the European patent application's file, thus exempting the applicant from filing said copy where, based on an agreement with the national patent offices, the priority of a first filing made in one of the following states is claimed:

– Austria (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 19 September 2012, OJ EPO 2012, 540)

– People's Republic of China (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 8 April 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A38)

– Czech Republic (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 11 July 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A79)

– Denmark (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 10 December 2014, OJ EPO 2015, A2)

– Japan (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 December 2010, OJ EPO 2011, 62)

– Republic of Korea (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 27 February 2013, OJ EPO 2013, 216)

– Spain (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 10 February 2016, OJ EPO 2016, A18)

– Sweden (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 May 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A39)

– Switzerland (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 4 June 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A55)

– United Kingdom (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 December 2010, OJ EPO 2011, 62)

– United States of America (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 December 2010, OJ EPO 2011, 62)

For divisional applications, where the results of the search on the claimed priority have already been provided in respect of the parent application, the applicant need not provide them again in respect of the divisional application (see the notice from the EPO dated 28 July 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 410).

Rule 141(2)7. Title of the invention

7.1 Requirements

7.2 Responsibility7.1 Requirements

The request for grant must contain the title of the invention. A requirement of Rule 41(2)(b) is that the title must clearly and concisely state the technical designation of the invention and must exclude all fancy names. In this regard, the following should be taken into account:

(i)personal names, fancy names, the word "patent" or similar terms of a non-technical nature that do not serve to identify the invention should not be used

(ii)the abbreviation "etc.", being vague, should not be used and should be replaced by an indication of what it is intended to cover

(iii)titles such as "Method", "Apparatus", "Chemical Compounds" alone or similar vague titles do not meet the requirement that the title must clearly state the technical designation of the invention

(iv)trade names and trade marks should also not be used; the Receiving Section, however, need only intervene when names are used which, according to common general knowledge, are trade names or trade marks.

Rule 41(2)(b)7.2 Responsibility

The examining division bears ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the title accords with the provisions of the Implementing Regulations. The search division will nevertheless take action and amend the title to avoid, if possible, the publication of applications having titles that obviously do not comply with the applicable EPC provisions (see also F‑II, 3). In such cases, the EPO will change the title on its own initiative if this appears necessary (see OJ EPO 1991, 224).

The applicant learns if the title proposed has been approved by the search division upon transmission of the European search report. The wording of the title (in the three official EPO languages), as approved by the search division, is notified by the communication announcing the forthcoming publication.

The title of the invention is published and entered in the European Patent Register (Rule 143(1)(c)) in capital letters.

Rule 41(2)(b)8. Prohibited matter

8.1 Morality or "ordre public"

8.2 Disparaging statements8.1 Morality or "ordre public"

The application must not contain statements or other matter contrary to "ordre public" or morality. Such matter may be omitted when the application is published, the published application indicating the place and number of words or drawings omitted. (Where drawings are omitted regard should be had to the physical requirements of A‑III, 3.2.) The Receiving Section may check the description, claims and drawings to ascertain whether they contain offending matter. In order not to delay unduly the formalities examination, if carried out, this will entail a cursory examination to ensure that the application does not contain the following prohibited matter: statements constituting an incitement to riot or to acts contrary to "ordre public", racial, religious or similar discriminatory propaganda, or criminal acts and grossly obscene matter. The Receiving Section may also take action to prevent the publication of such matter where the search division draws its attention to such matter which it had overlooked. The applicant is notified of the material omitted. In practice, it will usually be the search division that brings the existence of such material in the application to the attention of the Receiving Section.

Art. 53(a) Rule 48(1)(a) and Rule 48(2)8.2 Disparaging statements

According to Rule 48(1)(b), the application must not contain statements disparaging the products or processes of any particular person other than the applicant, or the merit or validity of applications or patents of any such person. However, mere comparisons with the prior art are not to be considered disparaging per se. Statements clearly falling into this category that are evident from the cursory examination referred to in A‑III, 8.1 or to which attention is drawn by the search division may be omitted by the Receiving Section when publishing the application. In cases of doubt the matter should be left for the examining division. The published application must indicate the place and number of any words omitted and the EPO must furnish, upon request, a copy of the passage omitted. The applicant is again notified of the material omitted. (See also treatment of prohibited matter in proceedings before the examining division, F‑II, 7.)

Rule 48(1)(b) and Rule 48(3)9. Claims fee

A European patent application containing more than 15 claims at the time of filing the claims (see the paragraph below) incurs a claims fee in respect of each claim in excess of that number. For applications filed and international applications entering the regional phase on or after 1 April 2009, a higher amount is payable for each claim in excess of 50. The claims' order is their sequence at their time of filing. If an application contains more than one set of claims, Rule 45 only applies to the set of claims containing the highest number of claims. If, as a result of claims having been deleted owing to non-payment of claims fees, the number of claims remaining in the set that originally incurred the fees falls below that of another set, then the number of claims in the latter set has to be reduced to the same number as that remaining in the set originally incurring the fees (see J 8/84). The claims fees must be paid within one month of filing the claims.

Where correct claims are filed under Rule 56a(3) or Rule 56a(4) (see A‑II, 6), the claims fee is calculated on the basis of the set of claims first filed.

The claims may be filed at the following stages:

(a)on the filing date or on the date on which the divisional application is filed (see A‑II, 4.1.5 and A‑IV, 1.2.1)

(b)after the filing date, in a timely response to a communication from the EPO indicating their absence under Rule 58 (see A‑III, 15)

(c)after the filing date, by applicants on their own initiative before the EPO sends a communication according to Rule 58 (see A‑III, 15).

Consequently, the claims fees must be paid within one month of whichever of the above dates of receipt applies.

If the claims fees have not been paid in due time, they may still be validly paid within a non-extendable grace period of one month from notification of a communication under Rule 45(2) pointing out the failure to observe the time limit. The applicant cannot waive this communication. If a claims fee is not paid within the grace period, the corresponding claim is deemed abandoned and the applicant is notified accordingly. The applicant cannot waive the communication under Rule 112(1) noting the deemed abandonment of claims under Rule 45(3). If the claims fees paid are insufficient to cover all the claims incurring fees (i.e. claim 16 onwards), and if when payment was made no indication was given as to which claims were covered by the fees paid, then the applicant is requested to specify which claims incurring fees are covered by the claims fees paid. The Receiving Section notifies the search division of claims that are deemed abandoned. Any claims fee duly paid is refunded only in the case referred to in Rule 37(2) (see A‑II, 3.2, last paragraph).

In cases where:

(i)the application was filed by reference to a previously filed application (see A‑II, 4.1.3.1) and

(ii)the applicant indicates on filing that the claims of this previously filed application take the place of claims in the application as filed,

the claims fees are due within one month of the filing date (since the claims of the previously filed application are effectively present on the filing date). However, the EPO will not send the applicant a communication under Rule 45(2) with an invitation to pay any claims fees due until the applicant has, within two months of the filing date (Rule 40(3)), filed the copy of the previously filed application, since it is only at this point that the EPO will know how many claims there are and consequently how many claims fees, if any, are due.

Features of a claim deemed abandoned under Rule 45(3) and not otherwise to be found in the description or drawings cannot subsequently be reintroduced into the application and, in particular, into the claims (see J 15/88). However, by filing a divisional application, applicants can pursue any (features of a) claim deemed abandoned due to non-payment of the claims fee in the procedure for the grant of a patent for the parent application.

Regarding Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase, see E‑IX, 2.1.3 and E‑IX, 2.3.8.

Rule 45(1) to Rule 45(3) Rule 112(1) Rule 37(2) Art. 2(1), item 15, RFees10. Abstract

10.1 General remark

10.2 Content of the abstract

10.3 Figure accompanying the abstract10.1 General remark

Every application for a patent must contain an abstract. The effect of non-compliance with this requirement is dealt with in A‑III, 16.

Art. 78(1)(e) Art. 90(3) Rule 57(d)10.2 Content of the abstract

While responsibility for the definitive content of the abstract lies with the EPO (see F‑II, 2), in practice, this is delegated to the search division since the definitive content of the abstract must be determined and transmitted to the applicant along with the search report. Where the search division confirms that the abstract filed does not relate to the claimed invention, the applicant is informed that the document filed does not constitute an abstract and is invited to correct the deficiency (see A‑III, 16).

Rule 6610.3 Figure accompanying the abstract

If the application contains drawings, applicants should indicate the figure (or figures, in exceptional cases) of the drawings that they suggest should accompany the abstract. Where this requirement is not met, the search division decides which figure(s) to publish. For the further procedure, see F‑II, 2.4.

Rule 47(4)11. Designation of contracting states

11.1 General remarks

11.2 European patent applications filed on or after 1 April 2009

11.3 European patent applications filed before 1 April 200911.1 General remarks

All states party to the EPC at the application's filing date are deemed designated in the request for grant of a European patent (for a list of the EPC contracting states, see General Part, section 6). Any other state entered on the request for grant must be disregarded (for the designation of contracting states on the request for grant form, see A‑III, 11.2.2, A-III, 11.3.5 and A-III, 11.3.6). When the application is in the name of joint applicants, each may designate different contracting states (see A‑II, 2); objection is to be raised during the examination of formal requirements if there is any ambiguity as to the states designated by the individual applicants.

Art. 79(1)11.2 European patent applications filed on or after 1 April 2009

11.2.1 Designation fee; time limits

11.2.2 Payment of designation fee

11.2.3 Consequences of non-payment of the designation fee

11.2.4 Withdrawal of designation

11.2.5 Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase11.2.1 Designation fee; time limits

A designation fee is payable for designating contracting states.

For applications filed on or after 1 April 2009 this is a flat fee covering all EPC contracting states. Therefore, for these applications, the system of charging designation fees for individual designated states (see A‑III, 11.3) no longer applies. For European divisional applications, see also A‑IV, 1.3.4 and A-IV, 1.4.1.

Art. 79(2) Rule 39 Art. 149(1) Art. 2(1), item 3, RFees

For European patent applications, the designation fee must be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report.

Rule 39

For divisional applications and new applications under Art. 61(1)(b), the designation fee must be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report drawn up in respect of the European divisional application or the new European patent application (see A‑IV, 1.4.1).

For Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase on or after 1 April 2009, see A‑III, 11.2.5.

Rule 17(3) Rule 36(4)11.2.2 Payment of designation fee

All states party to the EPC at the time of filing a European patent application are automatically designated when the application is filed. The designation fee, however, may be paid later (see A‑III, 11.2.1).

Rule 39(1)

Payment of the designation fee covers all contracting states, except those for which the designation has been expressly withdrawn.

Art. 2(1), item 3, RFees

Such payment simply needs to be marked "designation fee" in order for the purpose of the payment to be established.

Art. 6(1) RFees11.2.3 Consequences of non-payment of the designation fee

An application is deemed withdrawn where the designation fee has not been paid by expiry of the period specified in Rule 39(1).

In this case, the EPO sends the applicant a communication under Rule 112(1) notifying them of the loss of rights. In response, the applicant can request further processing according to Art. 121 and Rule 135 (see E‑VIII, 2).

The loss of rights ensues on expiry of the period under Rule 39(1) and not on expiry of the period for further processing (see G 4/98, mutatis mutandis).

For Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase on or after 1 April 2009, see A‑III, 11.2.5.

Rule 39(2)11.2.4 Withdrawal of designation

Subject to the final sentence of this paragraph, the applicant may withdraw the designation of one or more contracting states at any time up to the patent's grant. Withdrawing the designation of all contracting states results in the application being deemed withdrawn and the applicant being notified accordingly.

In neither case is a validly paid designation fee refunded (see A‑X, 10.1.1).

Art. 79(3) Rule 39(2) and Rule 39(3)

A contracting state's designation may not be withdrawn from the date a third party proves to the EPO that they have initiated entitlement proceedings and up to the date when the EPO resumes proceedings for grant.

The applicant may withdraw designations when filing the European patent application, e.g. to avoid overlapping prior national rights with the priority application according to Art. 139(3). Timely payment of the designation fee will not cause those designations that have been withdrawn to be reactivated.

For European divisional applications, see A‑IV, 1.3.4.

Rule 1511.2.5 Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase

For Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase, the designation fee must be paid within 31 months of the filing or priority date, if the time limit specified in Rule 39(1) has expired earlier.

Rule 159(1)(d)

According to Rule 160(1), if the designation fee for the Euro-PCT application entering the European phase is not paid within the basic period under Rule 159(1)(d), the European patent application (see Art. 153(2)) is deemed withdrawn. If the EPO finds that that has occurred, it notifies the applicant of this loss of rights according to Rule 112(1). In response, the applicant can request further processing according to Art. 121 and Rule 135.

For the designation fee in relation to Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase, see also E‑IX, 2.1.4 and E‑IX, 2.3.11.

Rule 160 Art. 153(2)11.3 European patent applications filed before 1 April 2009

This section refers to the relevant provisions that were in force until 31 March 2009 and that remain applicable to European patent applications filed and Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase before 1 April 2009.

11.3.9 Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase before 1 April 200911.3.1 Designation fee; time limits

A designation fee is payable for designating contracting states. A single joint designation fee is payable for Switzerland and Liechtenstein. All contracting states are deemed designated on payment of seven times the amount of one designation fee.

For European patent applications, the designation fees must be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report.

Art. 79(2) Rule 39, in force until 31 March 2009 Art. 149(1) Art. 2(2), item 3 RFees and Art. 2(2) item 3a RFees

For divisional applications and new applications under Art. 61(1)(b) filed before 1 April 2009, the designation fees must be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report drawn up in respect of the European divisional application or the new European patent application (see A‑IV, 1.4.1).

For Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase before 1 April 2009, see A‑III, 11.3.9.

Rule 17(3), in force until 31 March 2009 Rule 36(4) in force until 31 March 200911.3.2 Consequences of non-payment of designation fees

The designation of a state is deemed withdrawn where the designation fee has not been paid in due time for that state (see also A‑III, 11.3.4).

If the designation fee for a particular contracting state is not paid in time, the EPO sends the applicant a communication under Rule 112(1) notifying them of the designation's deemed withdrawal according to Rule 39(2). In response, the applicant can request further processing according to Art. 121 and Rule 135 in respect of this partial loss of rights (see E‑VIII, 2). This communication is not sent if the applicant waives the right to receive it in respect of the state in question by selecting the appropriate box on the request for grant form. By selecting that box, the applicant waived the right to further processing in respect of the designation or designations in question.

For Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase before 1 April 2009, see A‑III, 11.3.9.

Rule 39(2), in force until 31 March 200911.3.3 Amount paid insufficient

If, during the period for requesting further processing, designation fees are paid without an additional sum sufficient to cover the further processing fee, it is first necessary to establish how many designation fees including the further processing fee are covered by the total sum paid. The applicant must then be invited, under Art. 6(2) RFees, first sentence, RFees, to indicate which contracting states the designation fees plus further processing fee are to be used for (see J 23/82, mutatis mutandis). For the subsequent procedure, see A‑III, 11.3.7.

Art. 6(2) RFees, 1st sentence, RFees11.3.4 Application deemed withdrawn

An application is deemed withdrawn where no designation fee is validly paid by expiry of the period specified in Rule 39(1).

If no designation fees are paid on time leading to the deemed withdrawal of the application under Rule 39(3), in force until 31 March 2009, the EPO sends the applicant a communication according to Rule 112(1) notifying them of this loss of rights. In response, the applicant can request further processing according to Art. 121 and Rule 135 in respect of this total loss of rights (see E‑VIII, 2).

Where the application is deemed withdrawn because of failure to pay the designation fees, the loss of rights ensues on expiry of the normal period under Rule 39(1). Similarly, the deemed withdrawal of a contracting state's designation takes effect upon expiry of the period under Rule 39(1), and not upon expiry of the period for further processing (see G 4/98, mutatis mutandis). The applicant is notified of the loss of rights and can remedy it by requesting further processing according to the procedures explained in A‑III, 11.3.2.

Rule 39(3), in force until 31 March 200911.3.5 Request for grant form

All states party to the EPC at the time of filing a European patent application are automatically designated when the application is filed. The designation fees payable for an application filed before 1 April 2009, however, may be paid later.

Applicants have time – until expiry of the period for paying the designation fees (Rule 39(1) and Rules 17(3) and Rule 36(4)) – to decide which contracting states they actually want their patent to cover. This is done by paying the designation fees for those states, which may include an additional sum required to validate a request for further processing.

Art. 79(1) and Art. 79(2)11.3.6 Indication of the contracting states

For European patent applications filed before 1 April 2009, the designation fees are deemed paid for all contracting states on payment of seven times the amount of one designation fee. Such payments simply need to be marked "designation fees" for the purpose of the payment to be established.

However, if the applicant intended to pay fewer than seven designation fees when filing the application, it was for them to indicate the contracting states they wanted to designate in the appropriate section of the request for grant form (EPO Form 1001, versions prior to April 2009). This was to ensure that the designation fees paid were properly entered in the books. Non-payment of designation fees within the basic time limit results in a communication under Rule 112(1).

In response, the applicant may request further processing in respect of the lost designation(s). However, no Rule 112(1) communication will be sent and no further processing can be requested for designations in respect of which the applicant waived these rights by selecting the appropriate box on the request for grant form or where the designation in question was withdrawn.

For applicants taking part in the automatic debiting procedure, see also A‑X, 7.2.

Art. 2(2), item 3, RFees Art. 6(1) RFees11.3.7 Amount payable

If, given the amount payable within the time limit in question, the sum paid for designation fees during the periods under Rule 39(1) or Rule 135(1) does not cover all the contracting states indicated on the request for grant form (EPO Form 1001) and no indication is provided of the contracting states the fees are intended for, then the payer is requested to indicate, within a period stipulated by the EPO, which states are to be designated (see also A‑III, 11.3.3). If the payer fails to comply in due time, then Art. 8(2) RFees 1973 applies: the fees are deemed paid only for as many designations as are covered by the amount paid in the order in which the contracting states were designated (see J 23/82, mutatis mutandis). The designation of contracting states not covered by the fees is deemed withdrawn and the applicant is notified of the loss of rights (see A‑III, 11.3.4, paragraph 3, regarding the time at which loss of rights ensues).

Art. 6(2) RFees, 1st sentence, RFees Art. 8(2) RFees 2nd sentence, RFees, in force until 31 March 2009 Rule 39(2), in force until 31 March 2009 Rule 112(1)11.3.8 Withdrawal of designation

Subject to the final sentence of this paragraph, the applicant may withdraw a contracting state's states's designation at any time up to the patent's grant. A validly paid designation fee is not refunded when a designation is withdrawn. Withdrawing the designation of all contracting states results in the application being deemed withdrawn and the applicant being notified accordingly. A contracting state's designation may not be withdrawn from the date a third party proves to the EPO that they have initiated entitlement proceedings and up to the date when the EPO resumes proceedings for grant.

The applicant may withdraw designations when filing the European patent application, e.g. to avoid overlapping prior national rights with the priority application according to Art. 139(3). Timely payment of designation fees will not cause those designations that have been withdrawn to be reactivated. Furthermore, no Rule 112(1) communication will be sent in respect of a failure to pay designation fees for any designation withdrawn.

Art. 79(3) Rule 39(3) in force until 31 March 2009 and (4), in force until 31 March 2009 Rule 1511.3.9 Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase before 1 April 2009

For Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase, a designation fee with respect to each contracting state designated, up to a maximum of seven times the amount of one designation fee to designate all contracting states, must be paid within 31 months of the filing or priority date if the time limit specified in Rule 39(1) has expired earlier. The principles laid down in A‑III, 11.3.3, 11.3.6, 11.3.7 and 11.3.8 for European patent applications filed before 1 April 2009 apply to Euro-PCT applications in accordance with Art. 153(2), with the individual contracting states being indicated in the request for entry into the European phase (EPO Form 1200).

Rule 159(1)(d)

Under Rule 160(2), the designation of a contracting state for which no designation fee has been paid in time is deemed withdrawn. According to Rule 160(1), if no designation fee is paid within the basic period under Rule 159(1)(d) for a Euro-PCT application entering the European phase, the European patent application (see Art. 153(2)) is deemed withdrawn. If the EPO finds that the deemed withdrawal of a European patent application or of a contracting state's designation has occurred, it notifies the applicant of this loss of rights according to Rule 112(1). In response, the applicant can request further processing according to Art. 121 and Rule 135.

For designation fees in relation to Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase, see also E‑IX, 2.1.3 and E‑IX, 2.3.11.

Rule 160, in force until 31 March 2009 Art. 153(2)12. Extension and validation of European patent applications and patents to/in states not party to the EPC

12.1 General remarks

12.2 Time limit for payment of extension and validation fees

12.3 Withdrawal of the extension or validation request

12.4 Extension and validation deemed requested

12.5 National register12.1 General remarks

At the applicant's request and on payment of the prescribed fee, European patent applications (direct or Euro-PCT) and thus patents can be extended to European states having an extension agreement with the EPO (extension states). The same applies to requests for validation in European or non-European states having a validation agreement (validation states).

The states for which such requests may currently be filed are listed below:

(i)extension may be requested for the following European state:

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BA) since 1 December 2004

The EPO's extension agreements with the Republic of Slovenia (entry into force: 1 March 1994), the Republic of Romania (15 October 1996), the Republic of Lithuania (5 July 1994), the Republic of Latvia (1 May 1995), the Republic of Croatia (1 April 2004), the Republic of North Macedonia (as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) (1 November 1997), Albania (1 February 1996), the Republic of Serbia (1 November 2004) and Montenegro (1 March 2010) terminated when these countries acceded to the EPC with effect from 1 December 2002, 1 March 2003, 1 December 2004, 1 July 2005, 1 January 2008, 1 January 2009, 1 May 2010, 1 October 2010 and 1 October 2022 respectively. However, the extension system continues to apply to all European and international applications filed prior to those dates and to all European patents granted in respect of such applications.

(ii)validation may be requested for the following states (OJ EPO 2015, A20, OJ EPO 2015, A85, OJ EPO 2017, A85, and OJ EPO 2018, A16, and OJ EPO 2023, A105):

Morocco (MA) since 1 March 2015 Republic of Moldova (MD) since 1 November 2015 Tunisia (TN) since 1 December 2017 Cambodia (KH) since 1 March 2018 Georgia (GE) since 15 January 2024

Extension and validation agreements are bilateral international treaties concluded between the European Patent Organisation and an individual state. Within the territory of that state, the effects of a European patent application for which an extension or validation request has been filed, or of a European patent that has been validated in an extension or validation state, are based on national law. The provisions of the EPC, its Implementing Regulations and the Rules relating to Fees do not apply to the extension and validation systems unless and only to the extent that those provisions are referred to by the applicable national law. Thus, the EPC provisions concerning applicants' legal remedies and appeals do not apply in respect of any action taken by the EPO under the extension or validation procedure (see J 14/00, J 4/05 and J 22/10), e.g. where the extension or validation fee has not been paid within the applicable time limit indicated (A‑III, 12.2). Similarly, no different claims, description or drawings are acceptable in respect of extension or validation states (see H‑III, 4.4), as Rule 138 does not apply to the extension and validation systems.

A request for extension to or validation for the above-mentioned states is deemed made with any European patent application filed after entry into force and, in the case of the former, before termination of the respective extension agreements. This also applies to Euro-PCT applications, provided that the EPO has been designated for a European patent and the extension or validation state has been designated for a national patent in the international application. The request is deemed withdrawn if the extension or validation fee is not paid within the prescribed time limit (see A‑III, 12.2). It is by paying the extension or validation fee that the applicant decides to extend the application to an extension state or validate it in a validation state. The declaration in the appropriate section of the request for grant form (EPO Form 1001) or of EPO Form 1200 for entry into the European phase before the EPO where the applicant is asked to state whether they intend to pay the extension or validation fee is merely for information purposes and intended to assist in recording fee payments.

A request for extension or validation in respect of a divisional application (see A‑IV, 1) is deemed made only if the respective request is still effective in the parent application when the divisional application is filed.12.2 Time limit for payment of extension and validation fees

Under the applicable national provisions of the extension and validation states, the extension or validation fee must be paid

(i)for European patent applications within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report

(ii)for Euro-PCT applications within the period for performing the acts required for an international application's entry into the European phase or within six months of the date of publication of the international search report, whichever is the later.

If the fee for an extension or validation state has not been paid within the corresponding basic period (see items (i) and (ii) above), the applicant can still pay the extension or validation fee together with a 50% surcharge

(a)within a grace period of two months from expiry of the basic period for payment or

(b)if the designation fee has not been paid, along with the filing of a valid request for further processing concerning the designation fee, within two months of notification of a communication of loss of rights with regard to the designation fee (see the notices from the EPO dated 2 November 2009, OJ EPO 2009, 603, and 5 February 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A19).

If the applicant fails to pay the extension or validation fee during the basic and the grace period, the request for extension or validation is deemed withdrawn. No communication of loss of rights is issued.

However, a noting of loss of rights for failure to pay the designation fee under Rule 39(2) or Rule 159(1)(d) will draw the applicant's attention to the non-payment of the extension or validation fee, where appropriate, triggering the time limit mentioned in item (b) above.

A request for re-establishment of rights according to Art. 122 and Rule 136 is not possible in respect of payment of the extension or validation fee.12.3 Withdrawal of the extension or validation request

The request for extension or validation may be withdrawn at any time. It will be deemed withdrawn if the European patent or Euro-PCT application is finally refused, withdrawn or deemed withdrawn. A separate communication is not issued to the applicant. Validly paid extension or validation fees are not refunded.12.4 Extension and validation deemed requested

Extension and validation are deemed requested in respect of all extension and validation states (see, however, A‑III, 12.1, sixth paragraph, regarding Euro-PCT applications), and this is indicated in the published application, the European Patent Register and the European Patent Bulletin. Those states for which the extension or validation fees have been paid are subsequently indicated in the European Patent Register, the European Patent Bulletin and the published patent specification.12.5 National register

Extension and validation states publish in their national register the relevant data relating to European patent applications and patents extending to their territory.13. Filing and search fees

13.1 Payment of fees

13.2 Additional fee (if application documents comprise more than 35 pages)

13.3 Additional fee for divisional applications13.1 Payment of fees

The applicant is required to pay a filing fee and, subject to the exception mentioned below (see the note to point (iii) below), a search fee. The filing and search fees must be paid within the following periods:

Art. 78(2)

(i)where neither (ii) nor (iii) applies, within one month of filing the European patent application

Rule 38

(ii)for European divisional applications or European patent applications filed according to Art. 61(1)(b), within one month of filing the divisional or Art. 61(1)(b) application

Rule 36(3) Rule 17(2)

(iii)for Euro-PCT applications, within 31 months of the filing date or, where applicable, from the earliest claimed priority date*.

Note that when a supplementary European search report is dispensed with by the EPO (see B‑II, 4.3), no search fee is required for the Euro-PCT application (Rule 159(1)(e)).

Rule 159(1)

With regard to applications of types (i) and (ii), the EPO will check that these fees have been paid. If either fee is not paid on time, the application is deemed withdrawn. The applicant will be notified by the EPO as to the loss of rights according to Rule 112(1) and can respond by requesting further processing according to Art. 121 and Rule 135.

Under Art. 2(1) RFees as amended by Administrative Council decision of 13 December 2017 (OJ EPO 2018, A4), the filing fee amount depends on the method and format used for filing the European patent application or its translation, if applicable. However, where a fee level relates to a means of electronic communication or a particular electronic document format, that level only applies when the means or format, as referred to in Art. 2(1) RFees, is made available. The date on which such fee level applies is to be specified by the EPO President (see Art. 2(4) RFees as adopted by Administrative Council decision of 12 December 2018, OJ EPO 2019, A3, and the notice from the EPO dated 24 January 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A6). At present, for European patent applications, the fee levels of the filing fee and of the fee for grant for filing in character-coded format (DOCX) are not applied. The latest information on the applicable fee levels and amounts can be found on the EPO website (see also A‑X, 1).

With regard to Euro-PCT applications (type (iii)), see E‑IX, 2.1.4.

Art. 90(3) Rule 57(e) Art. 78(2) Rule 36(3) Rule 17(2)

For the reduction of the filing fee under the language arrangements, see A‑X, 9.2.1 and A-X, 9.2.2.

Rule 6(3) to Rule 6(7)13.2 Additional fee (if application documents comprise more than 35 pages)

This section relates only to applications filed and international applications entering the European phase on or after 1 April 2009 (see also the notice from the EPO dated 26 January 2009, OJ EPO 2009, 118, and its supplement, OJ EPO 2009, 338).

EP-direct applications

An additional fee is payable as part of the filing fee for European patent applications filed on or after 1 April 2009 and comprising more than 35 pages. The fee amount depends on the number of pages over 35. The language reduction under Rule 6(3) applies if the requirements of Rule 6(4), Rule 6(6) and Rule 6(7) have been met (see A‑X, 9.2.1 and A‑X, 9.2.2). The additional fee is payable within one month of the application's filing date or of the date of receipt of a European divisional application or a European patent application according to Art. 61(1)(b). If the application is filed without claims or by reference to a previously filed application, the additional fee is payable within one month of filing the first set of claims or the certified copy of the application referred to in Rule 40(3), whichever expires later. The additional fee is calculated on the basis of the pages of the description, claims, any drawings and one page for the abstract, in the language of filing. Where formal deficiencies in the documents making up the European patent application need to be corrected, the number of pages complying with the physical requirements (see A‑III, 3 and A‑IX) is taken as the basis for calculation. In particular, deficiencies relating to minimum margins, each document making up the application starting on a new sheet, line spacing and character size as well as the scale of drawings can potentially impact the number of pages (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A113). Where this is the case, any additional fee due for the higher number of pages may be paid within two months of the invitation under Rule 58 drawing the applicant's attention to this requirement.

The pages of the request for grant (EPO Form 1001) and those forming part of a sequence listing within the meaning of Rule 30(1) are not counted, provided the sequence listing contained in the description is filed in XML format, in compliance with WIPO Standard ST.26 (see OJ EPO 2021, A97). By way of exception, an additional fee is not due either for a parent application's ST.25 sequence listing filed in PDF format as part of a divisional application (see OJ EPO 2023, A98, and A‑IV, 5.4). If the application is filed by reference to a previously filed application, the pages of the certified copy, excluding those for the certification, and for bibliographic data and any sequence listing in ST.25 if it is contained in the certified copy under Rule 40(3), are taken as the basis for the calculation, excluding the pages for the certification, for bibliographic data and any sequence listing in ST.25 format contained in the certified copy under Rule 40(3). If the application is filed without claims, the additional fee takes account of the pages of the first set of claims filed.

Where missing parts are filed under Rule 56 (see A‑II, 5) or correct application documents are filed under Rule 56a (see A‑II, 6), the additional fee is calculated on the basis of the documents present at expiry of the time limit under Rule 38(3).

Euro-PCT applications

For international (Euro-PCT) applications entering the European phase on or after 1 April 2009, the additional fee is payable as part of the filing fee within the 31-month period of Rule 159(1). It In general, is calculated on the basis of the international application as published, regardless of the language of publication. The pages of the description, claims and drawings are counted, as well as one page for the bibliographic data with abstract. Any amendments under Art. 19 PCT and/or Art. 34 PCT are also considered part of the international publication and are taken into account for calculating the additional fee unless the applicant indicates that the procedure in the European phase is not to be based on them. The indications made in EPO Form 1200 should be clear so the EPO can readily identify the pages for which the additional fee is payable. (even if published in a non‑EPO language), any amended claims under Art. 19 PCT, which replace the claims as originally filed unless otherwise specified (see OJ EPO 2017, A74), and one page for the abstract. If there is more than one page of bibliographic data, the further pages are not counted. The pages of the latest set of any amended documents (Art. 34 PCT, amendments filed upon entry) on which European phase processing is to be based (Rule 159(1)(b)) will also be taken into account where available to the EPO by the date of payment of the additional fee within the 31 months. Any amended pages are added to the calculation of the page fee unless the applicant clearly specifies, at the latest by the date of payment, the amended pages which are to replace the corresponding pages of the application as published (see also E‑IX, 2.1.1). This information should preferably be given in the relevant section of the form for entry into the European phase, and in particular in the related table (see notes on EPO Form 1200). If the applicant explicitly states that application documents filed on entry into the European phase have merely been reformatted (to reduce the number of pages subject to payment of an additional fee) rather than substantively amended, the EPO disregards these reformatted application documents and does not accept them as the basis for calculation of the additional fee (see the notice from the EPO dated 26 January 2009, OJ EPO 2009, 118, and its supplement, OJ EPO 2009, 338).

The pages of EPO Form 1200 itself and those forming part of a standard-compliant sequence listing under Rule 30(1) are not counted.

Amended application

If amendments are filed on entry into the European phase, the basis for calculating the additional fee depends on the language in which the international application was published, i.e. one of the EPO's official languages or another language, e.g. Chinese.

(i)International publication is in an EPO language

The additional fee is based on the application as published, whereby any amended pages replace the respective pages of the application as published.

If the claims have been amended, the applicant must submit the entire set, even if the amendment concerns only some of them. The additional fee is then based on the entire set of claims as amended.

(ii)International publication is not in an EPO language

If no amendments are filed on entry into the European phase, the application as published in a non‑EPO language (e.g. Chinese) is taken as the basis for calculating the additional fee. However, if pages are amended, the translation of the application as required under Art. 153(4) and Rule 159(1)(a) is taken as the basis instead. This is because the replacement pages are in a different language to the published pages, which would make a proper calculation of the additional fee impossible. Therefore, if the description or drawings are amended, the translation of the description or drawings is taken as the basis for calculating the additional fee. In this case, the amended pages replace the respective pages of the description or drawings as translated.

If only the claims are amended, the additional fee is based on the description and drawings as published in Chinese plus the entire set of claims as amended in the EPO language. If the claims are not amended, the additional fee is based on the claims as published in Chinese.

Any replacement pages must be filed in an official EPO language. Where the international application has not been published in an official EPO language, the additional fee for any amended description or drawings will be based on the translation of the international application filed on entry into the European phase (see E‑IX, 2.1.4). Where claims are replaced, they must be submitted as an entire new set. The additional fee is then calculated on the basis of the amended set in the EPO language (OJ EPO 2009, 338).If the applicant explicitly states that application documents filed on entry into the European phase have merely been reformatted (to reduce the number of pages subject to payment of an additional fee) rather than substantively amended, the EPO disregards these reformatted application documents and does not accept them as the basis for calculation of the additional fee (see the notice from the EPO dated 26 January 2009, OJ EPO 2009, 118, and its supplement, OJ EPO 2009, 338).

EPO Form 1200 is disregarded in the calculation of the additional fee.

The pages of any WIPO Standard ST.25-compliant sequence listing in TXT format filed as part of the description are disregarded when calculating the additional fee for Euro-PCT applications with an international filing date prior to 1 July 2022. If the international filing date is on or after 1 July 2022, the pages of a WIPO Standard ST.26-compliant sequence listing in XML format are disregarded.

In application of the general principles described above, for international applications comprising both erroneously filed application documents and correct application documents incorporated by reference (Rule 20.6 PCT in conjunction with Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT), irrespective of their date of filing (see OJ EPO 2020, A81, and OJ EPO 2022, A71; see also C‑III, 1.3), the additional fee must be paid for all application documents contained in the international publication unless any are replaced by amendments filed on entry into the European phase, as specified by the applicant.

For international applications with an international filing date on or before 31 October 2022, corrections that the receiving Office allowed to be incorporated under Rule 20.6 PCT in conjunction with Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT are not effective in proceedings before the EPO as designated or elected Office (see OJ EPO 2020, A81). Nevertheless, the above general principles for calculating the additional fee apply. However, where applicants choose the abridged procedure outlined in C‑III, 1.3 and the declaration to renounce the correct application documents incorporated by reference under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT is received within the 31-month period for entering the European phase and before payment of the additional fee, this renunciation is, for the calculation of the additional fee, equal to an amendment of the international application as published. Accordingly, those pages identified in the publication of the international application as "Incorporated by reference (Rule 20.6)" are deducted from the international application as published. The same principle applies if, within the 31-month period for entering the European phase, the applicants declare their intention to renounce the erroneously filed application documents and, thus, the initial filing date. In that case, the erroneously filed pages are deducted from the international application as published when calculating the additional fee.

Where the international application was published in a non‑EPO language, the general practice described above also applies. Since the applicant's intention to follow the abridged procedure on entry into the European phase is considered an amendment of the international application as published, the additional fee is calculated on the basis of the translation of those application documents that are maintained for the further proceedings (either the correct application documents incorporated by reference or the erroneously filed ones) and any further amendments replacing (part of) them (see the notice from the EPO dated 14 June 2020, OJ EPO 2020, A81).

Example 1:

International application, published in English, containing 100 pages:

Abstract 1 Description 50 Claims 20 Drawings 20 claims, Art. 19 PCT 9 Total pages 100 Amended claims (EP entry) 10

On entry into European phase, within the 31-month period, 10 pages of amended claims are filed to replace previous pages of claims, as indicated by the applicant in EPO Form 1200.

→ number of pages on which calculation is based: 100 - 20 (original claims) - 9 (Art. 19 PCT) + 10 (amended claims on EP entry) - 35 (fee-exempt)

→ number of pages to be paid for: 46

Example 2:

International application, published in Chinese, containing 75 pages:

Number of pages in Chinese (ZH) Number of pages in English (EN), translation filed on entry into the European phase Abstract 1 1 Description 40 50 Claims 15 25 Drawings 19 19 Total number of pages 75 95 Amended description of the translation - 3

On entry into the European phase, the translation into English is filed within the 31-month period. Three pages of the translated description as originally filed are replaced by three amended pages, as indicated by the applicant in EPO Form 1200.

→ number of pages on which calculation is based: 35 (abstract, claims and drawings in ZH) + 47 (EN translation of description - 3) + 3 (amended description of the translation) - 35 (fee-exempt)

→ number of pages to be paid for: 50

If in the above example only the claims are amended, the additional fee is based on the description, drawings and abstract as published in Chinese and the translation of the entire set of claims as amended.

Pages of amendments filed after the additional fee's payment date, in particular during the Rule 161(1) or Rule 161(2) period (see E‑IX, 3), are not taken into account. Consequently, if amendments filed at this stage reduce the number of pages already paid for, no refund will be made.

Rule 38(2) and Rule 38(3) Art. 2(1), item 1a, RFees

Rule 49

If the additional fee is not paid on time, the application is deemed withdrawn. The EPO will notify the applicant of the loss of rights according to Rule 112(1); the applicant can request further processing according to Art. 121 and Rule 135. The further processing fee is calculated on the basis of the number of pages on file at the relevant period's expiry and for which the additional fee, calculated as set out above has not been paid. The amount of the further processing fee in respect of the additional fee does not take into account the basic filing fee according to Art. 2(1), item 1, RFees if this was paid on time.

Art. 78(2)13.3 Additional fee for divisional applications

Regarding the additional fee payable as part of the filing fee for divisional applications of second or subsequent generations filed on or after 1 April 2014, see A‑IV, 1.4.1.1 and the notice from the EPO dated 8 January 2014, OJ EPO 2014, A22.

Rule 38(4) Art. 2(1), item 1b, RFees14. Translation of the application

There are three situations in which a translation of the European patent application will be required:

(i)the European patent application was filed according to Art. 14(2) in a non‑EPO language

(ii)the European patent application was filed by reference to a previously filed application in a non‑EPO language (Rule 40(3))

(iii)the European divisional application was filed in the same language as the earlier (parent) application on which it is based, where this was not an official EPO language (Rule 36(2) – see A‑IV, 1.3.3).

In all cases, a translation of the application must be filed at the EPO: in cases (i) and (ii) this must occur within two months of the filing date according to Rule 6(1) (for type (i)) or Rule 40(3) (for type (ii)); in case (iii) it must occur within two months of the divisional application's filing according to Rule 36(2).

Art. 14(2) Rule 6(1)

The EPO will check compliance with this requirement. If the translation has not been filed, the EPO will invite the applicant to rectify this deficiency under Rule 58 within two months in accordance with the procedure explained in A‑III, 16.

Art. 90(3) Rule 57(a)

Failure to file the translation on time in response to the invitation under Rule 58 results in the application being deemed withdrawn according to Art. 14(2). The EPO will then notify the applicant of this loss of rights according to Rule 112(1). Further processing is ruled out by Rule 135(2) for the above time limits for supplying the translation under Rule 40(3), Rule 6(1) and Rule 36(2) and for the time limit for rectifying the failure to file the translation under Rule 58. Consequently, further processing is not possible in this case. However, the applicant may request re-establishment according to Art. 122 and Rule 136 for failure to comply with the time limit under Rule 58.

For translations in respect of international applications entering the European phase, see E‑IX, 2.1.2.

Rule 5815. Late filing of claims

To obtain a filing date, the European patent application does not have to contain any claims. The presence of at least one claim is nonetheless a requirement for a European patent application according to Art. 78(1)(c), but a set of claims can be provided after the filing date according to the procedure described below.

Art. 80 Rule 40(1)

The EPO will check whether at least one claim is present in the application. If there is not, the EPO will issue an invitation under Rule 58 inviting the applicant to file one or more claims within two months. If the applicant fails to do so within this period, the application is refused according to Art. 90(5). The applicant is notified of this decision according to Rule 111. Further processing for failure to observe the time limit under Rule 58 is ruled out under Rule 135(2). The applicant may, however, request re-establishment according to Art. 122 and Rule 136 or may appeal.

Where the application documents as originally filed did not include at least one claim, applicants may also file claims on their own initiative after the filing date but before the EPO invites them to do so under Rule 58. In this case, the EPO does not issue a communication under Rule 58.

If the applicant does supply a set of claims in response to the invitation under Rule 58, the claims must have a basis in the application documents (description and any drawings) provided on the filing date (Art. 123(2)). This requirement will first be checked at the search stage (see B‑XI, 2.2).

If the application was filed by means of a reference to a previously filed application in accordance with Rule 40(3) and the applicant indicated on the filing date that the previously filed application's claims were to take the place of claims in the application as filed (see A‑II, 4.1.3.1), then, provided the previously filed application also contained claims on its filing date, claims were present on the filing date and no communication under Rule 58 will be sent.

The above procedure also applies to divisional applications (Art. 76(1)) and applications filed in accordance with Art. 61(1)(b).

Art. 90(3) and Art. 90(5) Rule 57(c) Rule 5816. Correction of deficiencies

16.1 Procedure for formalities officers

16.2 Period allowed for remedying deficiencies16.1 Procedure for formalities officers

Where, when examining for compliance with the requirements set out in earlier sections of this chapter, the formalities officer discovers deficiencies that may be corrected, they must give the applicant the opportunity to rectify each such deficiency within a specified period. The most common potential deficiencies at this stage of the procedure and the provisions governing their rectification are:

A‑III, 2 Representation Rule 58 A‑III, 3 Physical requirements Rule 58 A‑III, 4 Request for grant Rule 58 A‑III, 5 Designation of inventor Rule 60 A‑III, 6 Claim to priority Rule 52(3) , Rule 59 A‑III, 9 Payment of claims fees Rule 45 A‑III, 10 Abstract Rule 58 A‑III, 13 Filing fee, including any additional fee, search fee Rule 112(1) , Rule 135 A‑III, 14 Translation of the application Rule 58 A‑III, 15 Late filing of claims Rule 58 A‑IV, 5 Late furnishing of a standard-compliant sequence listing Rule 30(3)

The formalities officer should raise all formal objections that become evident from a first examination of the application – with the exception of those noted in A‑III, 3.2 – in the appropriate communication. The definitive resolution of certain matters will likely be impossible at this stage, e.g. filing of priority documents for which the filing period has not expired, and further reports may be necessary. If the applicant is required to appoint a representative but has not done so, the formalities officer should deal with only this deficiency in the first report. Any request(s) for correction of other deficiencies will not be sent until a representative has been appointed, and will be sent to that representative.

Art. 90(3)16.2 Period allowed for remedying deficiencies

The period for remedying the following deficiencies is two months from a communication pointing them out according to Rule 58:

(i)non-appointment of a representative where the applicant has neither residence nor principal place of business in a contracting state – see A‑III, 2 (regarding failure to file an authorisation where this is necessary, see A‑VIII, 1.5 and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, L.1)

(ii)documents making up the application not complying with physical requirements (see A‑III, 3)

(iii)request for grant (with the exception of the priority criteria) not satisfactory (see A‑III, 4)

(iv)abstract not filed (see A‑III, 10)

(v)where required, translation of the application not filed (see A‑III, 14)

(vi)no claims (see A‑III, 15).

Rule 58

The period under Rule 58 is not extendable. If the above deficiencies under (i)-(iv) or (vi) are not rectified in time, the application is refused under Art. 90(5). If the deficiency under (v) is not rectified in time, the application is deemed withdrawn under Art. 14(2). Under Rule 135(2), further processing is ruled out for all of the above losses of rights, which all arise from the failure to observe the time limit of Rule 58.

The following deficiencies are rectified under provisions other than Rule 58:

(vii)non-payment of the claims fees (Rule 45 – see A‑III, 9)

(viii)priority document or file number of the previous application is missing (Rule 59 – see A‑III, 6)

(ix)non-payment of filing fee, including any additional fee, and search fee (see A‑III, 13)

(x)non-filing of a standard-compliant sequence listing (Rule 30(3) – see A‑IV, 5).

Art. 90(5) Art. 14(2)

According to Rule 45(2), the period for remedying deficiencies related to the payment of claims fees under (vii) is one month from a communication pointing out their non-payment. Failure to correct this deficiency in time leads to the claims in question being deemed abandoned under Rule 45(3). Further processing applies to this loss of rights.

Rule 45

Deficiencies under (viii) are to be corrected within two months of a communication under Rule 59. This period can be extended under Rule 132(2) (see E‑IX, 2.3.5 for Euro-PCT applications) but further processing is ruled out by Rule 135(2). Failure to correct this deficiency in time leads to the loss of the priority right.

Art. 90(5) Rule 59

Failure to pay the filing, additional or search fee on time results in the deemed withdrawal of the application according to Art. 78(2). This loss of rights ensues directly on expiry of the applicable time limit (see A‑III, 13). A deficiency Deficiencies under (ix) can be corrected by requesting further processing.

Art. 78(2)

The deficiency under Rule 30(1) can be corrected within two months of a communication under Rule 30(3). This period is not extendable but further processing is available. Failure to correct this deficiency in time leads to the refusal of the European patent application (see A‑IV, 5).

Where appropriate, the search division is informed of any loss of rights.

1.8 Search, publication and request for examination of divisional applications1.1 General remarks

A divisional application may be filed relating to any pending earlier European patent application. A divisional application filed on the same day as the parent application is not considered validly filed. The term "earlier application" is understood to mean an application filed at least one day before the divisional application and refers to the immediate application on which the divisional application is based ("parent application"). Where the earlier application is a Euro-PCT application, a divisional application can only be filed upon the earlier application's effective entry into the European phase (see E‑IX, 2.4.1).

The divisional application is accorded the same filing date as the parent application and benefits from any priority right of the parent application in respect of the subject-matter contained in the divisional application (see A‑IV, 1.2.1).

Where the applicant inserts missing parts of the description and/or missing drawings under Rule 56 (see A‑II, 5) or corrects erroneously filed parts under Rule 56a (see A‑II, 6) after the divisional application's date of receipt, the requirements of Rule 36(1) may no longer be fulfilled (see A‑IV, 1.1.1). If the divisional application claims priority, the date of receipt does not change if the missing parts or the correct application documents are completely contained in the earlier application whose priority is claimed (Art. 88(1)).

A European patent application may give rise to more than one divisional application. A divisional application may itself give rise to one or more divisional applications.

Where a divisional application is deemed not validly filed due to non-fulfilment of one of the filing conditions (see also A‑IV, 1.1.1 and 1.1.3), the applicant will be duly informed in a communication under Rule 112(1) stating that the application will not be processed as a European divisional application and providing the opportunity to apply for a decision on the EPO's findings under Rule 112(2) (see E‑VIII, 1.9.3). Any fees paid will be refunded if the loss of rights becomes final.

Art. 76 Rule 36(1)

1.1.1 Pendency of the earlier application

1.1.2 Sequences of divisional applications

1.1.3 Persons entitled to file a divisional application1.1.1 Pendency of the earlier application

The parent application must be pending when a divisional application is filed. Reference is made in this regard to the observations in G 1/09 and J 18/09 as to what constitutes a pending application. In the case of an application filed as a divisional application from an application that is itself a divisional application, it is sufficient that the latter is still pending on the second divisional application's date of receipt.

An application is pending up to (but not on) the date that the European Patent Bulletin mentions the grant of the patent (OJ EPO 2002, 112). Rule 134 does not apply in this case. It is not possible to validly file a divisional application when the parent application has been finally refused, withdrawn or is deemed withdrawn (see also the paragraphs below).

If an application is deemed withdrawn due to non-observance of a time limit (e.g. following failure to pay the filing fee (Art. 78(2)), a renewal fee (Art. 86(1)), the fee for grant and publishing or the claims fees, or to file the translation of the claims (Rule 71(7)) in due time), the application is no longer pending when the non-observed time limit has expired.

If a renewal fee is not paid by the due date (Rule 51(1)), the application is pending up to the last day of the six-month period for payment of that fee with an additional fee (Rule 51(2), first sentence), and a divisional application may still be filed during this period – even if the fees are ultimately not paid. Deemed withdrawal of the application takes effect on expiry of the six-month period (Rule 51(2), second sentence).

Once the application is deemed withdrawn, a divisional application can only be validly filed if the loss of rights, as communicated under Rule 112(1), is subsequently remedied. In such a case, the application is deemed to have been pending throughout.

Depending on the non-observed time limit, the loss of rights may be remedied either by means of an allowable request for further processing (see E‑VIII, 2) or, where applicable, by a request for re-establishment of rights (see E‑VIII, 3). Furthermore, if the findings in the notice of loss of rights are considered inaccurate, the applicant may also request a decision under Rule 112(2) (see E‑VIII, 1.9.3). If the competent EPO body shares this opinion or if it gives an unfavourable decision that is subsequently overturned on appeal, no loss of rights will have ever occurred and the application will have been pending throughout (see J 4/11, reasons 22). The same applies if the appeal decision is set aside by the grant of a petition for review and the appeal proceedings are reopened under Art. 112a(5), with the consequence that the decision under Rule 112(2) is overturned.

If an application has been refused and no appeal has (yet) been filed, the application is still pending within the meaning of Rule 36(1) until expiry of the time limit for filing the notice of appeal (Art. 108), and a divisional application can be validly filed until this period expires (see G 1/09). Where the applicant does validly file a notice of appeal but fails to submit the written statement setting out the grounds of appeal, the refused application is pending until the time limit for filing the grounds of appeal under Art. 108 expires (see J 23/13). If the grounds of appeal are submitted in due time, the decision to refuse cannot take effect until the appeal proceedings are over. As the provisions relating to the filing of divisional applications also apply in appeal proceedings (Rule 100(1)), a divisional application may then be filed while such appeal proceedings are under way. If the appeal proceedings are reopened under Art. 112a(5), the application will have been pending throughout.

If the parent application is withdrawn by the applicant, a divisional application can be filed up to (i.e. including) the date on which the declaration of withdrawal is received by the EPO.

While proceedings are stayed in accordance with Rule 14(1) (see A‑IV, 2.2), divisional applications cannot be filed. Rule 14(1) constitutes a lex specialis with regard to the right to file a divisional on a pending application provided for in Rule 36(1) (see J 20/05 and G 1/09, reasons 3.2.5).

If a purported divisional application is filed when the parent application is not pending, the EPO will issue a communication under Rule 112(1) (see A‑IV, 1.1). The pendency of the earlier application is not a procedural deadline or time limit that would lead to a loss of rights in the event of non-compliance. Instead, it is a condition of a substantive nature for the filing of divisional applications (see G 1/09, reasons 3.2.3). Therefore, the provisions on re-establishment of rights and further processing do not apply to the filing of divisional applications (see J 10/01, reasons 15).

Art. 112a(5)1.1.2 Sequences of divisional applications

A divisional application can also be an earlier application within the meaning of Art. 76(1) for one or more further divisional applications. The characterising feature of a sequence of divisional applications, each divided out from its predecessor, is that each member of the sequence claims as date of filing the date of the root application in which the subject-matter divided out in sequences of divisional applications was first disclosed (see G 1/05, G 1/06).

In a sequence of divisional applications, a first-generation divisional application is a divisional application based on an application that is not itself a divisional application, i.e. the root application. A second-generation divisional application is a divisional application based on a first-generation divisional application; and so on.1.1.3 Persons entitled to file a divisional application

Only the applicant on record of the earlier application may file a divisional application. In the case of multiple applicants, a divisional application may only be filed jointly by all applicants on record. This means that, in the case of a transfer of an application, a divisional application may only be filed by or on behalf of the new applicant(s) if the transfer was duly registered and therefore effective vis-à-vis the EPO (Rule 22) at the divisional application's date of receipt. A purported divisional application that is not (jointly) filed in the name of the applicant(s) of the parent application will not be processed as a European divisional application. The EPO will inform applicants by issuing a communication under Rule 112(1) (see A‑IV, 1.1).1.2 Date of filing of a divisional application; claiming priority

1.2.1 Date of filing

1.2.2 Priority claim of a divisional application1.2.1 Date of filing

A European divisional application may be filed in respect of subject-matter not extending beyond the content of the parent application as filed. Provided this requirement is met, the divisional application is deemed filed on the parent application's filing date and enjoys that application's priority (see A‑IV, 1.2.2).

Art. 76(1), 2nd sentence

A divisional application filed in due form, i.e. meeting the requirements of Art. 80 and Rule 40(1) (see A‑II, 4.1 et seq.), is accorded the same filing date as the parent application or that of the root application in the case of a sequence of divisional applications. Whether the divisional application's subject-matter is confined to that of the parent application is not decided until the examination procedure (see C‑IX, 1.4 et seq.). The term of a patent granted for a European divisional application is 20 years from its filing date, i.e. the filing date of the root application.

Since Rule 40(1) does not require a European patent application to contain any claims on its filing date, the same applies to a European divisional application. The applicant can file the claims after filing the divisional application according to the procedures detailed in A‑III, 15. This may be done after the parent application is no longer pending, provided that the requirements of Rule 40(1) were satisfied with regard to the divisional application when the parent application was still pending. If the parent application's claims are included in the divisional application's description, they must be clearly identified as part of the description (see F‑IV, 4.4).

Art. 63(1) Art. 80 Rule 40(1)1.2.2 Priority claim of a divisional application

A priority claimed in the parent application also applies to the divisional application, provided that the parent application's priority claim has not been lost or withdrawn by the date the divisional application is filed; it is not necessary to claim it formally a second time. The priority claim can be withdrawn in respect of the divisional application (F‑VI, 3.5, E‑VIII, 8.2 and E‑VIII, 8.3). However, this will have no effect on the parent application's priority claim. Similarly, any withdrawal of the priority claimed in the parent application after the divisional application's filing has no effect on the latter's priority claim.

Where the parent application claims multiple priorities under Art. 88(2), the applicant may claim fewer priorities in respect of the divisional application. To do so, they must file a clear and unambiguous withdrawal of the priority claim or claims in question in respect of the divisional application (see the notice from the EPO dated 12 November 2004, OJ EPO 2004, 591). In the absence of such a withdrawal, all priorities that have not lapsed in respect of the parent application when the divisional is filed also remain valid with respect to that application. What is more, all such priority claims remain valid for the divisional, even if the applicant provides an incorrect or incomplete priority claim when filing it.

If a certified copy and a translation of the previous application, if applicable (see A‑VII, 3.3), have been filed in respect of the parent application before the divisional application is filed, it is not necessary to file the priority document and any translation again in respect of the divisional. The EPO makes a copy of these documents and places them in the divisional application's file (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, B.2).

If, when the divisional application is filed, a priority document has not been filed in respect of the parent application, it must be filed in respect of the divisional application and, if the priority claim of the parent application's remaining subject-matter is to be retained, in respect of the parent application also. Applicants can also inform the EPO, within the time limit set for filing priority documents in the divisional application proceedings, that they have meanwhile submitted these documents in respect of the parent application. If the divisional application's subject-matter relates only to some of the priorities claimed in the parent application, priority documents in respect of the divisional application need be filed for those priorities only.

Art. 76(1) Rule 53(2) and Rule 53(3)

This applies also as regards indicating the file number of the previous application. For the time limits for indicating the file number and for filing the priority documents, see A‑III, 6.5, A-III, 6.5.3 and A-III, 6.7 et seq.

1.3.2 Request for grant

1.3.3 Language requirements

1.3.4 Designation of contracting states

1.3.5 Extension and validation states1.3.1 Where and how to file a divisional application

A divisional application must be filed with the EPO. must be filed with the EPO in Munich, The Hague or Berlin by delivery by hand, by postal services or by fax. It may also be filed using EPO Online Filing, Online Filing 2.0, or the EPO web-form filing service or the EPO Contingency Upload Service (see A‑II, 1.1.1 A‑II, 1.2.2). If filed by delivery by hand, by postal services or by fax, divisional applications must be filed with the EPO in Munich, The Hague or Berlin.

The filing of a European divisional application with a national authority has no effect in law; the authority may however, as a courtesy service, forward the European divisional application to the EPO. If a competent national authority chooses to forward the application, it is not deemed received until the documents have reached the EPO.

The divisional application may be filed by reference to a previously filed application. The procedures are as provided for in Rule 40(1)(c), Rule 40(2) and Rule 40(3) (see A‑II, 4.1.3.1). Where the divisional application is filed by reference to an international application that has effectively entered the European phase (see A‑IV, 1.1) and was not filed with the EPO as receiving Office, a certified copy of the international application originally filed with the PCT receiving Office must be filed (OJ EPO 2009, 486).

Rule 36(2) Rule 35(1)1.3.2 Request for grant

The request for grant of a patent must contain a statement that a divisional application is sought and state the number of the parent application. It should also mention which generation of divisional application is being filed (Rule 38(4), Art. 2(1), item 1b, RFees). If the request is deficient, as can arise if there is no indication that the application constitutes a divisional application, even though some of the accompanying documents contain an indication to that effect or if the number is missing, the deficiency may be corrected in the manner indicated in A‑III, 16 or under Rule 139 (see A‑V, 3).

Rule 41(2)(e)1.3.3 Language requirements

As indicated in A‑VII, 1.3, a divisional application must be filed in the language of the proceedings of the parent application. Alternatively, if the earlier (parent) application was filed in a non-official EPO language, the divisional application may be filed in the same language. In this case a translation into the language of the proceedings of the earlier application must then be filed within two months of filing the divisional application (see A‑III, 14).

Rule 36(2)1.3.4 Designation of contracting states

All contracting states designated in the earlier application at the time of filing a European divisional application are deemed designated in the divisional application (see also G 4/98). If no designations have been withdrawn in respect of the parent application, then all states party to the EPC at the date of the parent's filing are automatically designated in the divisional application when filed. Conversely, contracting states that have had their designation withdrawn in respect of the parent application at the time of filing the divisional application, cannot be designated in respect of the divisional application.

If the parent application was filed before 1 April 2009 and the time limit for paying the designation fees has not yet expired for the parent application when the divisional application is filed, and no designations have been withdrawn in respect of the parent application, then all states party to the EPC at the parent's filing date are automatically designated in the divisional application when it is filed. Conversely, contracting states that have had their designation withdrawn or deemed withdrawn in respect of the parent application at the time of filing the divisional application, cannot be designated in respect of the divisional application.

The flat designation fee payable for divisional applications filed on or after 1 April 2009 does not cover contracting states that have had their designation withdrawn or deemed withdrawn at the time of filing the divisional application.

Art. 76(2) Rule 36(4)1.3.5 Extension and validation states

All extension and validation states designated in the earlier application at the time of filing a European divisional application are deemed designated in the divisional application. For more details regarding the designation of these states, see A‑III, 12.1.1.4 Fees

1.4.1 Filing, search and designation fee(s)

1.4.2 Claims fees

1.4.3 Renewal fees1.4.1 Filing, search and designation fee(s)

The filing fee and search fee for the divisional application must be paid within one month of filing the European patent application. For the additional fee due for any pages in excess of 35, see A‑III, 13.2. For the additional fee due for divisional applications of second or subsequent generations, see A‑IV, 1.4.1.1. The designation fee(s) must be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report drawn up in respect of the divisional application.

The search fee must be paid even if a further search fee has already been paid under Rule 64(1) in respect of the search report on the parent application for the part of the application that was lacking in unity and that is now the subject of the divisional application (for reimbursement of the search fee, see A‑IV, 1.8).

Rule 36(3) and Rule 36(4) Art. 79(2)

If, within the applicable time limit, the filing, search or designation fees have not been paid, the application is deemed withdrawn. The EPO informs the applicant of these losses of rights in a communication under Rule 112(1). The applicant can request further processing according to Art. 121 and Rule 135.

For divisional applications filed before 1 April 2009, see A‑III, 11.3.2 and A-III, 11.3.4 for the deemed withdrawal of single designations or of the application and applicable remedies.

Rule 36(3) and Rule 36(4)

1.4.1.1 Additional fee for divisional applications of second or subsequent generations1.4.1.1 Additional fee for divisional applications of second or subsequent generations

An additional fee is payable as part of the filing fee for divisional applications of second or subsequent generations filed on or after 1 April 2014 (see the notice from the EPO dated 8 January 2014, OJ EPO 2014, A22). The fee amount varies depending on the generation to which the divisional application filed belongs (see A‑IV, 1.1.2). First-generation divisional applications are not subject to the additional fee. The fee amount grows progressively from the second to the fifth generation and becomes a flat fee for the fifth and subsequent generations (Art. 2(1), item 1b, RFees).

Example:

In this example, no additional fee would be due in respect of EP2 and EP3, as they are...

In this example, no additional fee would be due in respect of EP2 and EP3, as they are first-generation divisional applications. The amount of the additional fee for second-generation divisional applications would apply to EP4, and the amount for third-generation divisional applications would apply to EP5.

The additional fee is part of the filing fee for divisional applications of second and subsequent generations. Therefore, it must be paid within the same period as the filing fee, and the same provisions apply if not paid in due time (see A‑IV, 1.4.1). Likewise, the reduction of the filing fee under the language arrangements applies to this additional fee, provided that the requirements laid down in Rule 6(4) to Rule 6(7) are complied with (see A‑X, 9.2.1 and A-X, 9.2.2).

Rule 38 Art. 2(1), item 1b, RFees1.4.2 Claims fees

If, at the time of filing the first set of claims, the divisional application comprises more than 15 claims, a claims fee is payable in respect of each claim in excess of that number (see A‑III, 9). Claims fees are payable even if they were paid in the parent application in respect of claims relating to the subject-matter now the subject of the divisional application (see A‑III, 9).

Rule 45(1)1.4.3 Renewal fees

For the divisional application, as for any other European patent application, renewal fees are payable to the EPO. They are due in respect of the third year and each subsequent year, calculated from the date of filing of the earlier (parent) application or that of the root application in the case of a sequence of divisional applications. Under Art. 76(1) in conjunction with Rule 51(3), the parent application's filing date is also the date from which the time limits for paying the renewal fees for the divisional application (Art. 86(1)) are calculated. If, when the divisional application is filed, renewal fees for the parent application have already fallen due, these must also be paid for the divisional application and fall due when the latter is filed (see also A‑IV, 1.1.1). The period for paying these fees is four months after filing the divisional application. If not paid in due time, they may still be validly paid within six months of the date on which the divisional application was filed, provided that at the same time the additional fee of 50% of the renewal fees paid late is paid.

Art. 86(1) Art. 76(1) Rule 51(3) Art. 2(1), item 5, RFees

If, within the four-month period referred to above, a further renewal fee falls due or a renewal fee falls due for the first time, it may be paid without an additional fee within that period. It may otherwise still be validly paid within six months of the due date, provided that at the same time the additional fee of 50% of the renewal fee paid late is paid. When calculating the additional period the principles developed by the Legal Board of Appeal should be applied (see J 4/91).

Further processing for failure to pay renewal fees on time is ruled out by Rule 135(2). However, re-establishment is possible. In the case of applications for re-establishment of rights in respect of renewal fees falling due on filing of the divisional or within the four-month period laid down in Rule 51(3), second sentence, the one-year period prescribed by Rule 136(1) starts to run only after the six months under Rule 51(2) have expired.

Example:

25.03.2008: date of filing of parent application 11.01.2011: filing of divisional application and due date of renewal fee for the third year 31.03.2011: due date of renewal fee for the fourth year 11.05.2011: expiry of four-month period under Rule 51(3) 11.07.2011: expiry of six-month period under Rule 51(2) in respect of the renewal fee for the third year 30.09.2011: expiry of six-month period under Rule 51(2) in respect of the renewal fee for the fourth year 11.07.2012: expiry of one-year period under Rule 136(1) in respect of the renewal fee for the third year 01.10.2012: expiry of one-year period under Rule 136(1) in respect of the renewal fee for the fourth year (extended under Rule 134(1) ).

For other examples see A‑X, 5.2.4.

Rule 51(3) Art. 2(1), item 5, RFees1.5 Designation of the inventor

The provisions of A‑III, 5.4 apply with regard to the designation of the inventor, except that, where the designation of the inventor has not been provided or is deficient (i.e. it does not comply with Rule 19), the applicant will be invited to provide or correct it within a two-month period specified by the EPO (see E‑VIII, 1.6). The divisional application requires a separate designation, independent of the parent application on which it is based.

Rule 60(2)1.6 Authorisations

The provisions of A‑VIII, 1.5 and A-VIII, 1.6 apply with regard to authorisations in respect of the divisional application. If, according to these provisions, the representative has to file an authorisation, they may act on the basis of an individual authorisation filed in respect of the parent application only if it expressly empowers them to file divisional applications.1.7 Other formalities examination

Other than for matters referred to in A‑IV, 1.1 to A-IV, 1.6, the formal examination of divisional applications is carried out as for other applications. The provisions of Rule 30 apply with regard to divisional applications relating to nucleotide or amino acid sequences filed after 1 January 1993 (see A‑IV, 5).1.8 Search, publication and request for examination of divisional applications

Divisional applications are searched, published and examined in the same way as other European patent applications.

The search fee is refunded if the conditions of Art. 9(2) RFees are met (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 January 2022 17 January 2023 concerning the refund of the search fee under Art. 9(2) RFees, OJ EPO 2022, A8 OJ EPO 2023, A4, for divisional applications for which the search is completed on or after 1 April 2022).

The divisional application is published in accordance with Art. 93(1). The filing or priority date taken for calculation of the 18-month period for publication is the filing date or the earliest priority date claimed (see A‑IV, 1.2.1). Since this period has usually already expired when the divisional application is filed, the technical preparations for publication are completed as soon as all formal requirements with respect to the divisional application have been fulfilled. The applicant is informed of the intended publication date (see also A‑VI, 1.1).

The time limit for filing the request for examination begins to run on the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the search report concerning the divisional application.2. Art. 61 applications and stay of proceedings under Rule 14

2.1 General

2.2 Stay of proceedings for grant

2.3 Limitation of the option to withdraw the European patent application

2.4 Prosecution of the application by a third party

2.5 Filing a new application

2.6 Refusal of the earlier application

2.7 Partial transfer of right by virtue of a final decision2.1 General

Under Art. 61(1), a court or competent authority ("court") may by a final decision find that a person other than the registered applicant is entitled to the grant of a European patent. Provided that the European patent has not yet been granted, this third party may, within three months after the decision has become final, in respect of those contracting states designated in the European patent application in which the decision has been taken or recognised or has to be recognised on the basis of the Protocol on Recognition annexed to the European Patent Convention:

Art. 61(1) Rule 16

(i)prosecute the application as their own application in place of the applicant (see A‑IV, 2.4 and A-IV, 2.7)

Art. 61(1)(a)

(ii)file a new European patent application in respect of the same invention (see A‑IV, 2.5 and A-IV, 2.7) or

Art. 61(1)(b)

(iii)request that the application be refused (see A‑IV, 2.6 and A-IV, 2.7).

If the application is no longer pending due to its having been withdrawn, refused or being deemed withdrawn, the third party can still file a new European patent application in respect of the same invention, in accordance with Art. 61(1)(b) (see G 3/92).

Art. 61(1)(c)2.2 Stay of proceedings for grant

If a third party provides proof to the EPO that they have opened proceedings against the applicant for the purpose of seeking a judgement that they are entitled to the grant of the European patent, the EPO will stay the proceedings for grant unless it receives written consent from the third party to continue such proceedings. This consent is irrevocable.

Proceedings for grant may not be stayed before the publication of the European patent application. In the case of a Euro-PCT application proceedings may only be stayed after expiry of the time limit for entry into the European phase.

Furthermore, Rule 14(1) only refers to national entitlement proceedings that result directly, i.e. generally and automatically, in decisions mentioned in Art. 61(1) and not to proceedings initiated before a court of a non-contracting state (see J 6/03, r.21). Jurisdiction and the recognition of decisions regarding the right to the grant of a European patent for EPC contracting states are governed by the Protocol on Recognition, which under Art. 164(1) is an integral part of the EPC. Arbitration awards may be recognised, provided that they may automatically be recognised by all designated contracting states, e.g. in line with the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 10 June 1958.

The dates on which proceedings are stayed and resumed will be entered in the European Patent Register (Rule 143(1)(s)). They will also be communicated to the parties.

For the stay of opposition proceedings, see D‑VII, 4.1.

Rule 14(1)

2.2.1 Responsible department

2.2.2 Date of the stay of proceedings

2.2.3 Legal nature and effects of the stay

2.2.4 Interruption of time limits

2.2.5 Resumption of the proceedings for grant2.2.1 Responsible department

Sole responsibility for procedures where the applicant is not entitled lies with the EPO's Legal Division (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 21 November 2013, OJ EPO 2013, 600).

Art. 202.2.2 Date of the stay of proceedings

A stay of proceedings under Rule 14(1) takes immediate effect from the date the EPO receives satisfactory evidence that national proceedings have been instituted against the applicant seeking a decision within the meaning of Art. 61(1) (J 9/12).

The requirements for effectively initiating court proceedings are governed by national law (J 7/00).2.2.3 Legal nature and effects of the stay

The stay of proceedings is a unique preliminary procedural measure that is justified as a preventive measure to preserve the third party's possible rights to the patent in dispute and that takes immediate effect (J 28/94, J 15/06). In particular, the stay of the grant proceedings is ordered by a communication of the EPO without having heard the applicant. However, the applicant may, in view of that communication, request the issue of an appealable decision.

Stay of proceedings implies that the legal status quo existing at the time of the suspension is maintained, i.e. neither the EPO nor the parties can validly perform any legal acts while proceedings are suspended (J 38/92). In particular, the applicant is not allowed to withdraw either the European patent application or the designation of any contracting state (Rule 15). Likewise, no divisional application can be filed during the stay of proceedings (J 20/05 and J 9/12).

An automatic debit order ceases to be effective on the day a stay of the proceedings under Rule 14 takes effect (see point 11.1(c) AAD, Annex A.1 to the ADA, Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2022). Therefore, after resumption of proceedings a new automatic debit order must be filed if the applicant wishes to continue using the automatic debiting procedure.2.2.4 Interruption of time limits

The time limits in force at the date of stay other than time limits for payment of renewal fees are interrupted by such stay. The time that has not yet elapsed begins to run from the date on which proceedings are resumed. However, the time still to run after the resumption of the proceedings must not be less than two months. As for renewal fees, they continue to fall due during the period of stay. Also, in accordance with Rule 14(4), the period for payment of renewal fee with an additional fee provided for in Rule 51(2) is not interrupted.

Example: The European Patent Bulletin mentions the European search report's publication on 15 March 2017. Proceedings are stayed on Friday, 5 May 2017 and resumed on Friday, 18 August 2017. At the resumption of proceedings, the six-month period from the date of the mention of the search report's publication for payment of the examination fee (Rule 70(1)) does not begin to run again in its entirety but only for the days and months not yet elapsed. This time must not be less than two months (Rule 14(4)).

The six-month period starts on the day following the search report's publication, in accordance with Rule 131(2), i.e. on 16 March 2017, and ends on 15 September 2017. The period that is already running when proceedings are stayed on 5 May 2017 ends on 4 May 2017.

The period that has elapsed between 15 March 2017 and 4 May 2017 is one month and 19 days. The remaining period to run after the resumption is more than two months.

Calculation of the remaining non-elapsed period:

On the day of suspension, 5 May 2017, the first month of the running period has passed and so have 19 days of the second month. Thus, on that day, 11 days and four months remain (from 5 May 2017 to 15 May 2017 inclusive and from 15 May 2017 to 15 September 2017 inclusive). This non-elapsed period must be added to the date of resumption in order to calculate the deadline for payment of the examination fee.

Resumption is on 18 August 2017. All time limits start running again from and including this day (Rule 131(2) does not apply):

After adding first the remaining days and then the remaining months, it is necessary to check whether the last day falls on a day on which the EPO receives mail according to Rule 134(1): calculating 11 days from and including 18 August 2017 results in 28 August 2017. Adding four months to that gives 28 December 2017 as the end of the time limit for payment of the fee. Since the EPO was closed from Monday, 25 December 2017 to Monday, 1 January 2018, the period is extended to 2 January 2018 in accordance with Rule 134(1).

Rule 14(4)2.2.5 Resumption of the proceedings for grant

The date of resumption of proceedings as well as the legal basis for the resumption is to be communicated to the third party and the applicant.

Rule 14(3)

2.2.5.1 Resumption after final decision in entitlement proceedings

2.2.5.2 Resumption regardless of the stage of entitlement proceedings2.2.5.1 Resumption after final decision in entitlement proceedings

Grant proceedings will be resumed where evidence is provided that a final decision within the meaning of Art. 61(1) has been taken unless a new European patent application under Art. 61(1)(b) has been filed for all the designated contracting states. If the decision is in favour of the third party, the proceedings may not be resumed earlier than three months after the decision has become final unless the third party requests the resumption.

Rule 14(2)2.2.5.2 Resumption regardless of the stage of entitlement proceedings

The Legal Division may also order the resumption of grant proceedings regardless of the stage reached in the proceedings against the applicant. In this case, it is at the discretion of the Legal Division to decide whether the proceedings are to be continued. This discretion is to be exercised with due regard to the interests of the parties. In particular, the outcome of the court proceedings in the first instance and the duration of the stay of proceedings before the EPO are to be taken into consideration, as well as an evident abuse of proceedings, e.g. in the form of delaying tactics.

Rule 14(3)2.3 Limitation of the option to withdraw the European patent application

From the time when a third party proves to the EPO that they have initiated proceedings concerning entitlement (see A‑IV, 2.2) and up to the date on which the EPO resumes the proceedings for grant (see A‑IV, 2.2.5), neither the European patent application nor the designation of any contracting state may be withdrawn.

Rule 152.4 Prosecution of the application by a third party

Any third parties wishing to avail themselves of the possibility open to them under Art. 61(1)(a) (see A‑IV, 2.1(i)) must declare their intention in writing to the EPO in due time. They then take the place of the erstwhile applicant. The proceedings for grant are continued from the point reached when they were stayed or when the declaration was filed by the third party (see A‑IV, 2.2).

Art. 61(1)(a)2.5 Filing a new application

A new European patent application under Art. 61(1)(b) must be filed in electronically or on paper or electronic form with the EPO in Munich, The Hague, Munich or Berlin. It is not possible to file an application according to Art. 61(1)(b) with the competent authorities of a contracting state.

The new application is in many other respects treated as a European divisional application and corresponding provisions apply. In particular, the following provisions relating to divisional applications apply mutatis mutandis:

Art. 61(1)(b) Art. 76(1)

(i)accordance of the date of filing of the earlier application and entitlement to priority date – see A‑IV, 1.2;

(ii)information in the request for grant – see A‑IV, 1.3.2;

Art. 61(2)

(iii)filing, search, designation and claims fees – see A‑IV, 1.4.1 and A-IV, 1.4.2;

(iv)designation of inventor – see A‑IV, 1.5.

(v)language requirements – see A‑IV, 1.3.3.

Rule 17(2) and Rule 17(3) Rule 45(1)

However, arrangements for renewal fees are different. For the year in which the new application is filed and for the years beforehand, no renewal fees are payable.

In other respects the formal examination is carried out as for other applications.

If it is adjudged that a third party is entitled to the grant of a European patent for only some of the contracting states designated in the earlier application, and the third party files a new application for these states, the earlier application continues to be in the name of the earlier applicant for the remaining states.

Rule 51(6)

The earlier application is deemed withdrawn on the new application's filing date for the contracting states originally designated in which the decision has been taken or recognised.

Rule 17(1)2.6 Refusal of the earlier application

The EPO must accede to a third-party request under Art. 61(1)(c) to refuse the earlier application. The decision is open to appeal (Art. 106(1)).

Art. 61(1)(c)2.7 Partial transfer of right by virtue of a final decision

If by a final decision it is adjudged that a third party is entitled to the grant of a European patent in respect of only part of the matter disclosed in the European patent application, Art. 61 and Rules 16 and Rule 17 apply to that part.

Rule 18(1)3. Display at an exhibition

3.1 Certificate of exhibition; identification of invention

3.2 Defects in the certificate or the identification3.1 Certificate of exhibition; identification of invention

Where an applicant states when filing an application that the invention which is the subject of the application has been displayed at an official or officially recognised international exhibition falling within the terms of the Convention on international exhibitions, they must file a certificate of exhibition within four months of the filing of the European patent application. The exhibitions recognised are published in the EPO's Official Journal. The certificate must:

(a)have been issued during the exhibition by the authority responsible for the protection of industrial property at that exhibition

(b)state that the invention was exhibited at the exhibition

(c)state the opening date of the exhibition and the date of the first disclosure, if different from the opening date of the exhibition

(d)be accompanied by an identification of the invention, duly authenticated by the above-mentioned authority.

Art. 55(1)(b) and Art. 55(2) Rule 253.2 Defects in the certificate or the identification

The Receiving Section acknowledges receipt of the certificate and identification of the invention. It draws the applicant's attention to any manifest defects in said documents in case it is possible to rectify the deficiencies within the four-month period allowed. The applicant is notified according to Rule 112(1) if the certificate or identification is not furnished within the time allowed. The applicant may request further processing in respect of this loss of rights according to Art. 121 and Rule 135.4. Applications relating to biological material

4.1 Biological material; deposit of such

4.2 Missing information; notification

4.3 Availability of deposited biological material to expert only

4.4 Requests for samples of biological material4.1 Biological material; deposit of such

In accordance with Rule 26(3), "biological material" means any material containing genetic information capable of reproducing itself or being reproduced in a biological system.

Rule 26(3)

Where in relation to an application concerning biological material an applicant states having deposited in accordance with Rule 31(1)(a) the biological material with a depositary institution recognised for the purposes of Rules 31 and Rule 34, the applicant must, if such information is not contained in the application as filed, submit the name of the depositary institution and the accession number of the culture deposit and, where the biological material has been deposited by a person other than the applicant, the name and address of the depositor, within whichever of the following periods is the first to expire:

Rule 31(1)(c) and Rule 31(1)(d) Rule 31(2)

(i)within 16 months of the European patent application's filing date or the priority date, this time limit being deemed to have been met if the information is submitted before completion of the technical preparations for publication of the European patent application

Rule 31(2)(a)

(ii)if a request for early publication of the application according to Art. 93(1)(b) is submitted, up to the date of such submission

Rule 31(2)(b)

(iii)if it is communicated that a right to inspection of the files under Art. 128(2) exists, within one month of such communication.

Rule 31(2)(c)

Further processing is ruled out by Rule 135(2) for the above time limit according to Rule 31(2). Nor is Art. 122 applicable because a lack of disclosure cannot be remedied by way of re-establishment under Art. 122 (see the notice from the EPO dated 7 July 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 498).

Art. 83

Moreover, where the depositor and applicant are not identical, the same time limit applies for submitting a document satisfying the EPO that the depositor has authorised the applicant to refer to the deposited biological material in the application and has given unreserved and irrevocable consent to the deposited material being made available to the public in accordance with Rule 33(1) and Rule 33(2) or Rule 32(1). The depositor's authorisation for the applicant to refer to the deposit and the consent to the material being made available to the public must have existed from the filing date of the application in question. For a recommended wording for this declaration, see paragraph 3.5 of the above notice. For Euro-PCT applications, the document referred to above must be provided to the International Bureau before completion of the technical preparations for international publication (see the notice from the EPO dated 7 July 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 498, points II.7 to II.8).

Note, however, that where the depositor is one of several applicants the document referred to in Rule 31(1)(d) is not required (see the above notice).

Rule 31(1)(d)

The depositary institution must be on the list of depositary institutions recognised for the purposes of Rules 31 to Rule 34, as published in the EPO's Official Journal. This list includes the depositary institutions, especially the International Depositary Authorities under the Budapest Treaty. An up-to-date list is regularly published in the EPO's Official Journal.

The applicant is strongly recommended to file the deposit receipt issued by the depositary institution with the EPO since this document indicates, in particular, the depositor and shows the information required under Rule 31(1)(a) and (c). This information enables the EPO to certify any requests to issue a sample (see A‑IV, 4.2 and A‑IV, 4.4) and the examining division to establish whether the application satisfies the requirements under Art. 83 (see also F‑III, 6.2 and F‑III, 6.3). A deposit receipt must be filed for each sample of biological material disclosed in the application and deposited under the Budapest Treaty for the purposes of Rule 31. The deposit receipt may be filed as long as proceedings before the EPO are pending.

Rule 33(6)

4.1.1 New deposit of biological material

4.1.2 Application filed by reference to a previously filed application4.1.1 New deposit of biological material

If biological material deposited according to Rule 31 ceases to be available from the recognised depositary institution, an interruption in availability shall be deemed not to have occurred if:

(i)a new deposit of that material is made in accordance with the Budapest Treaty

(ii)a copy of the receipt of that new deposit issued by the depositary institution is forwarded to the EPO within four months of the date of the new deposit, stating the number of the European patent application or patent.

The non-availability may occur because, for example:

(a)the material has degraded such that it is no longer viable

(b)the authority with which the original deposit was made no longer qualifies for that kind of material, either under the Budapest Treaty or under bilateral agreements with the EPO.

In either case (a) or (b) above, a new deposit must be made within three months of the depositor's being notified of the non-availability of the organism by the depositary institution (Art. 4(1)(d) Budapest Treaty). This is subject to the exception where:

– the non-availability of the deposit is for the above reason (b) and

– the depositor does not receive the above notification from the depositary institution within six months of the date on which it is published by the International Bureau that the depositary institution is no longer qualified in respect of the biological material in question.

In this exceptional case, the new deposit must be made within three months of the date of the said publication by the International Bureau (Art. 4(1)(e) Budapest Treaty).

If, however, the original deposit was not made under the Budapest Treaty but rather at a depositary institution recognised by the EPO by virtue of a bilateral agreement, the above-mentioned six-month period is calculated from the date when the EPO publishes the fact that the depositary institution is no longer qualified to accept deposits of the biological material in question under that bilateral agreement.

Rule 344.1.2 Application filed by reference to a previously filed application

Where the application was filed by reference to a previously filed application in accordance with the procedures described in A‑II, 4.1.3.1 and the previously filed application referenced already satisfied the requirements of Rule 31(1)(b) and Rule 31(1)(c) on its filing date, these requirements will also be satisfied in respect of the European patent application.

If the information on the deposited biological material present in the previously filed application as filed does not satisfy Rule 31(1)(c), the EPO will not know this until the applicant files the certified copy and any required translation of the previously filed application (at the latest within two months of the filing date – Rule 40(3)). Even where the certified copy and any translation required are filed up to two months from the filing date, if the requirements of Rule 31(1)(c) are not satisfied, the time limit for rectification of this deficiency according to Rule 31(2) is unaffected (see A‑IV, 4.2).4.2 Missing information; notification

When the Receiving Section notices that the information required under Rule 31(1)(c) (indication of the depositary institution and accession number of the culture deposit) or the information and the document referred to in Rule 31(1)(d) (authorisation to refer to the deposit and consent to it being made available) is not contained in or has not yet been submitted with the application, it should notify the applicant of this fact, as this information can only be validly submitted within the time limits specified in Rule 31(2). In the case of missing information under Rule 31(1)(c), the deposit must be identified in the patent application as filed in such a way that the accession number submitted later can be traced back without ambiguity. This can normally be done by indicating the identification reference given by the depositor within the meaning of Rule 6.1(a)(iv) BT of the Budapest Treaty (see G 2/93). Where the depositary institution and/or the accession number is/are missing in the application on the date of filing but the applicant provides the information within the applicable time limit (Rule 31(2)), the missing information about the depositary institution and/or the accession number is published on the front page of the published European patent application (see A‑VI, 1.3).

The applicant is also informed when a deposit with a recognised depositary institution is referred to but no depositary institution receipt has been filed (the applicant is advised to provide this receipt when filing the application, if possible – see the notice from the EPO dated 7 July 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 498). Filing the receipt is essential for identifying the depositor, whose name needs to be established before the EPO can certify a third party's request for the issue of a sample of the deposited material (see also A‑IV, 4.1). Any further action, i.e. establishing whether the information available satisfies the sufficiency-of-disclosure requirement, is a matter for the examining division. See also F‑III, 6, in particular F‑III, 6.3(ii), as regards the examining division's treatment of applications relating to biological material. If the examining division is of the opinion that the invention is not sufficiently disclosed due to a lack of information concerning the biological material that constitutes the subject of the invention, it may refuse the European patent application (see F‑III, 3). Further processing is ruled out by Rule 135(2) for the time limit according to Rule 31(2) for supplying the information required by Rule 31(1)(c) and Rule 31(1)(d).

Art. 97(2) Rule 31 Art. 834.3 Availability of deposited biological material to expert only

Under Rule 32(1)(a) and Rule 32(1)(b), until the date on which the technical preparations for publication of the application are deemed complete, the applicant may inform the EPO that, until the publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent or, where applicable, for 20 years from the filing date if the application has been refused or withdrawn or is deemed withdrawn, the availability referred to in Rule 33 is to be effected only by the issue of a sample to an independent expert nominated by the requester.

The above communication must take the form of a written declaration addressed to the EPO. This declaration may not be contained in the description and the claims of the European patent application but may be given in the appropriate section of the request for grant form (EPO Form 1001).

If the declaration is admissible, it is mentioned on the front page when the European patent application is published (see also A‑VI, 1.3).

For Euro-PCT applications published in the international phase in an official EPO language, the applicant must request the expert solution from the International Bureau before completion of the technical preparations for international publication, preferably using Form PCT/RO/134 (see the notice from the EPO dated 7 July 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 498). For Euro-PCT applications not published in the international phase in an official EPO language, the applicant may request the expert solution under Rule 32(1) before completion of the technical preparations for publication of the translation of the international application required under Rule 159(1)(a) (see the above notice).

Rule 32(1)

If the applicant duly informs the EPO under Rule 32(1), the biological material is issued only to an independent expert nominated by the requester. The requirements and obligations applying to experts are laid down by the EPO President and are deemed fulfilled by signing the relevant declaration on a dedicated EPO form (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 10 July 2017, OJ EPO 2017, A60, and the notice from the EPO dated 10 July 2017, OJ EPO 2017, A61). Expert nominations must be accompanied by a declaration whereby the experts undertake to comply with the pertinent requirements and obligations and confirm that they know of no circumstances that might give rise to justified doubts as to their independence or that might conflict in any other way with their function as expert.

Rule 32(2)4.4 Requests for samples of biological material

From the date of publication of a European patent application relating to biological material, the biological material deposited in accordance with Rule 31 will be made available on request to any person having the right to inspect the files (see A‑XI, 1). Such availability will be effected by issuing a sample to the person making the request or, where the applicant has so requested, to an expert nominated by the requester (see A‑IV, 4.3). The EPO makes available on its website the forms to be used for obtaining samples of biological material deposited under the Budapest Treaty and that the EPO is asked to certify under Rule 33(4).

The EPO's certification of the request signals to the depositary institution that, based on its verification of the status of the application/patent and the related data in the EPO records, it may issue a sample of the biological material to the requester or the expert, as applicable. The EPO is exempted from verifying and assessing the expert's suitability and independence (OJ EPO 2017, A60).

After certification, the EPO will send the request to the depositary institution and copies to the applicant or proprietor of the European patent and to the certified party. It is up to the certified party to pay the fees requested by the recognised depositary institution direct to them.

Rule 335. Applications relating to nucleotide and amino acid sequences

If nucleotide and amino acid sequences within the meaning of Rule 30(1) are disclosed in the European patent application, they are to be represented in a sequence listing that complies with WIPO Standard ST.26. WIPO Standard ST.26 is a worldwide standard that, in Annex VII, contains recommendations on how to prevent potential added or deleted subject-matter in sequence listings due to conversion from WIPO Standard ST.25 to WIPO Standard ST.26. The EPO relies on these recommendations as guidance for examination. Each nucleotide or amino acid sequence extending over the minimum length as defined in the standard and disclosed in the application documents (including drawings) needs to be listed in the sequence listing, even if the sequence is only a fragment of another disclosed sequence. The sequence listing must be filed in electronic form, i.e. in XML format as required under WIPO Standard ST.26, using EPO Forms 1001E, 1200E or 1038E, which are available in EPO Online Filing and Online Filing 2.0, or on an electronic data carrier (see A‑II, 1.1.1 and OJ EPO 2023, A48). Where the European patent application is filed online, the electronic sequence listing in the required format is to be attached. The sequence listing must not be filed on paper or in PDF format. Regarding divisional applications, see A‑IV, 5.4. Nonetheless, if two or more sequence listings are filed on the filing date, only the standard-compliant sequence listing will be used as the basis for the search. See the decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 December 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A96, and the notice from the EPO dated 9 December 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A97, as well as the decision of the President of the EPO dated 24 April 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A46, and the notice from the EPO dated 24 April 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A47.

Where a sequence listing is filed or corrected after the filing date, the applicant is required to submit a statement that it does not include matter going beyond the content of the application as filed. Standard-compliant sequence listings filed subsequent to the filing date, i.e. in reply to the invitation under Rule 30(3), are not part of the description and, therefore, not published with the European patent application. Whenever a sequence listing that is part of the description is corrected or amended, a complete new sequence listing must be filed. The corrected or amended sequence listing must comply with the applicable WIPO standard, which depends on the application's date of filing. For applications filed on or after 1 July 2022, sequence listings must comply with WIPO Standard ST.26. For applications filed before that date, the sequence listing must comply with WIPO Standard ST.25.

For applications referring to sequences belonging to the prior art, see F‑II, 6.1.

Rule 57(j) Rule 30(1) Rule 30(2) Art. 123(2)

The Receiving Section will inform the applicant of any deficiencies as to the sequence listing or as to the necessary statements statement and issue an invitation to remedy the deficiencies and pay a late furnishing fee within a non-extendable period of two months. The late furnishing fee compensates for the administrative efforts of issuing the communication under Rule 30(3) and delaying the transmission of the application to the search division until after availability of a standard-compliant sequence listing. The late furnishing fee therefore does not have to be paid if the standard-compliant sequence listing is filed after the filing date but before the Receiving Section has issued the communication under Rule 30(3). If the requirements of Rule 30 in conjunction with the decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 December 2021 are not complied with in due time, where appropriate following the invitation to do so from the Receiving Section, which includes the payment of the late furnishing fee, the application will be refused according to Rule 30(3). This also applies if a sequence listing is subsequently filed in the required electronic format but still contains deficiencies with respect to the WIPO standard. Such deficiencies will not prompt the EPO to issue another invitation under Rule 30(3) triggering a new period of two months unless the previous invitation did not draw the applicant's attention to such remaining deficiencies (see J 7/11).

Art. 90(3) Rule 30(3)

The applicant may request further processing of the application (see E‑VIII, 2).

Art. 121 Rule 135

5.1 Sequence information filed under Rule 56

5.2 Sequence information filed under Rule 56a

5.3 Sequence listings of an application filed by reference to a previously filed application

5.4 Sequence listings of a divisional application5.1 Sequence information filed under Rule 56

The possibility of filing a sequence listing as a missing part of the description is, as a rule, very rare. The principle of Rule 56 is that it must be obvious from the application documents as filed that part of the description appears to be missing (see A‑II, 5.1). Very few cases fulfil the conditions for parts of the description being missing in the form of a sequence listing. Rule 56, for example, is applicable where the description quotes sequence identifier numbers (SEQ ID Nos.) but the sequences are not further disclosed in the description. Although in such a case the disclosure is missing in the form of a sequence listing, the Receiving Section is not expected to identify such omissions as qualifying for Rule 56, and according to Rule 56(1) the applicant may not invoke the omission of a communication under Rule 56(1) or (2). However, applicants may file the missing parts of the description relating to sequences on their own initiative within two months of the filing date according to Rule 56(2) (see A‑II, 5.2).

According to Rule 57(j), any late-filed sequence information will be checked for compliance with Rule 30(1) in conjunction with the rules laid down by the EPO President.

If the late-filed sequence information or sequence listing does not conform to the above requirements, then the communication under Rule 30(3) is sent to the applicant (see A‑IV, 5).

If, on the other hand, the late-filed sequence information includes a standard-compliant sequence listing according to the requirements of Rule 30(1), no Rule 30(3) communication will be sent. In such a case the late furnishing fee under Rule 30(3) does not fall due.

The above applies regardless of whether the late-filed parts of the description result in a change of the filing date (see A‑II, 5.3) or if the late-filed missing parts can be based on the claimed priority, allowing the original filing date to be maintained (see A‑II, 5.4). If, however, the late-filed parts of the description result in a change of the filing date, any communication according to Rule 30(3) which might be required will only be sent after the one-month period for the withdrawal of the late-filed parts has expired without the applicant having withdrawn them (see A‑II, 5.5).

In the case where the applicant inserts a sequence listing into the description as a late-filed part of the description according to Rule 56, the sequence listing so added, whether standard-compliant or not, is considered part of the description on the filing date (regardless of whether this has changed) and, consequently, is published with the European patent application.

The rare possibility to file a sequence listing as a late-filed missing part must, however, be clearly differentiated from those cases where the application as filed contains:

– the complete sequence information in the body of the description but no standard-compliant sequence listing

– a sequence listing that does not contain all sequences disclosed in the application documents

– a sequence listing that does not comply with the applicable WIPO standard.

In such cases, Rule 30 applies and the applicant will be invited under Rule 30(3) to file a standard-compliant sequence listing.5.2 Sequence information filed under Rule 56a

Erroneously filed sequence listings may be corrected under Rule 56a (see A‑II, 6).5.3 Sequence listings of an application filed by reference to a previously filed application

Where the application is filed by reference to a previously filed application (see A‑II, 4.1.3.1), and that previously filed application contained sequence listings on its filing date, then those sequence listings form part of the application as originally filed. This is subject to the exception that, where the sequences only appear in the claims and not in the description or drawings of the previously filed application, and the applicant did not include the claims of the previously filed application in the reference, then those sequences are not included in the European patent application as originally filed and a sequence listing must be filed separately. If in such a case the sequence listing is filed on the European patent application's filing date, it is published with the European patent application.

A sequence listing complying with the applicable WIPO standard and filed in the previously filed application after the filing date is not part of the description (Rule 30(2)) and, therefore, not included in the reference to the description and any drawings under Rule 40(1)(c). Consequently, the applicant must file a standard-compliant sequence listing for the European patent application separately.

Where the previously filed application is not available to the EPO, it will not be possible to carry out the check according to Rule 57(j) on the compliance of the sequence listing with Rule 30(1) until the applicant files the certified copy and any translation required, which must be done within two months of the filing date (Rule 40(3)). If, after receipt of the certified copy and translation, where applicable, the examination by the Receiving Section reveals that the sequence listing contained does not comply with Rule 30(1) in conjunction with the rules laid down by the EPO President, the EPO will send a communication according to Rule 30(3) inviting the applicant to correct any deficiencies and pay the late furnishing fee (see A‑IV, 5).

If the previously filed application referred to is a European patent application or an international application filed with the EPO as receiving Office, and the sequence listing contained satisfied the requirements of Rule 30 or Rule 5.2 PCT on its date of filing then all the requirements of Rule 30(1) are satisfied automatically on the filing date of the European patent application filed by reference to this application. If the sequence listing of the previously filed application does not comply with WIPO Standard ST.26, for instance because it was filed before the entry into force of the new WIPO standard, an invitation will be issued under Rule 30(3) to submit a standard-compliant sequence listing.

If the previously filed application was filed with any other office, the applicant will have to ensure that all the requirements of Rule 30(1), in conjunction with the rules laid down by the EPO President, are met. In particular, the applicant must consider that any electronic standard-compliant sequence listing filed on the filing date of the previously filed application will in most cases not be part of the certified copy under Rule 40(3) issued by the filing office: due to technical limitations, the certified copy received by the EPO will in most cases contain a converted sequence listing that is not standard-compliant. Hence, the applicant will still have to provide a standard-compliant sequence listing to the EPO to satisfy the above requirements. The same applies where the previously filed application was a European patent application or an international application filed with the EPO as receiving Office, but where one or more of the elements required to satisfy the requirements of Rule 30(1) or Rule 5.2 PCT in conjunction with WIPO Standard ST.26 were not present on the filing date. If this is not the case, the procedure in A‑IV, 5 will be followed (a communication under Rule 30(3) will be sent).

In alignment with the practice for divisional applications, a sequence listing in WIPO Standard ST.25 format contained in the certified copy under Rule 40(3) (e.g. converted from the TXT file available to the issuing office) is excluded from the calculation of the additional fee for pages in excess of 35 (see also A‑IV, 5.4 and A‑III, 13.2).5.4 Sequence listings of a divisional application

As an independent European patent application, a divisional application must also satisfy the requirements of Rule 30 in conjunction with the decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 December 2021 concerning the filing of sequence listings, OJ EPO 2021, A96 (see G 1/05, reasons 3.1). Without prejudice to the requirements of Art. 76(1), second sentence, if a sequence listing is to form part of the description of the divisional application, it must be submitted together with the other documents making up the divisional application unless reference is made to a previously filed application containing a sequence listing as part of the application (Rule 40(1)(c)). Where the sequence listing of the parent application is in a format complying with WIPO Standard ST.25, it must be converted into one complying with WIPO Standard ST.26. To avoid the potential risk of adding and/or losing subject-matter due to conversion, applicants may additionally file the parent application's ST.25 sequence listing in PDF format as part of the divisional application. In such cases, the pages of the ST.25 sequence listing are excluded from the calculation of the additional fee for pages in excess of 35 ("page fee"). The same practice applies to divisional applications filed by reference where the certified copy (Rule 40(3)) contains a sequence listing in ST.25 format (see also A‑IV, 5.3 and A‑III, 13.2). In order to comply with Rule 30(1), the sequence listing in WIPO Standard ST.26 format must in such cases be filed subsequently (see OJ EPO 2023, A98). The late furnishing fee under Rule 30(3) does not fall due if the ST.26 sequence listing is filed before the EPO issues the communication under Rule 30(3) (see A‑IV, 5).

However, an An applicant who has filed a WIPO Standard ST.26-compliant sequence listing under Rule 30 with regard to the earlier application (parent application) is exempted from having to submit said sequence listing if it is intended to be used for search purposes only (i.e. not as part of the description) in respect of the divisional application (the relevant check box for this is preselected in section 38.3 on Form 1001). This enables the EPO to add a copy of the standard-compliant sequence listing filed for the earlier (parent) application to the dossier of the divisional application in XML format and for search purposes only (see OJ EPO 2021, A97, point 18). However, since the content of the disclosure of the invention is the responsibility of the applicant, any sequence listing that is to form part of the description must be filed by them. The sequence listing of the earlier application is, thus, not automatically added to the dossier of the divisional application if

– the applicant files a WIPO Standard ST.26-compliant sequence listing as part of the divisional application's description

– the sequence listing available in the earlier application does not comply with WIPO Standard ST.26.6. Conversion into a national application

The central industrial property office of a contracting state must apply the procedure for the grant of a national patent or another protective right provided for by the legislation of that state at the request of the applicant for or the proprietor of the European patent under the circumstances specified in Art. 135(1). If the request for conversion is not filed within the three-month period specified in Rule 155(1), the effect referred to in Art. 66 will lapse (i.e. the European patent application will cease to be equivalent to a regular national filing in the designated contracting states).

Art. 135

The request for conversion is to be made to the EPO, except where the application is deemed withdrawn under Art. 77(3); in this case the request is filed with the central industrial property office with which the application was filed. That office will, subject to national security provisions, transmit the request direct to the central industrial property offices of the contracting states specified in it, together with a copy of the file relating to the European patent application. If the central industrial property office with which the application was filed does not transmit the request before the expiry of 20 months from the filing date, or if claimed, from the priority date, then Art. 135(4) applies (i.e. the effect of Art. 66 lapses).

Art. 135(2) Rule 155(2) and Rule 155(3)

If a request for conversion is filed with the EPO, it must specify the contracting states in which the application of national procedures is desired and be accompanied by a conversion fee. In the absence of the fee the applicant or proprietor is notified that the request will not be deemed filed until the fee is paid. The EPO transmits the request to the central industrial property offices of the specified contracting states accompanied by a copy of the files relating to the European patent application or patent.

Art. 135(3) Rule 155(2)Chapter V – Communications concerning formal deficiencies; amendment of application; correction of errors

1. Communications concerning formal deficiencies

2. Amendment of application

3. Correction of errors in documents filed with the EPO1. Communications concerning formal deficiencies

Where an application is found to be formally deficient during a formalities examination, the Receiving Section or, where appropriate, the examining division issues one or more communications to the applicant identifying all the particular EPC requirements not met and, in the case of deficiencies that can be corrected, inviting the applicant to correct them within specified periods (see A‑III, 16). In the exceptional case of communications that do not detail all deficiencies, see A‑III, 16.1. The applicant will be notified of the consequences, e.g. application deemed withdrawn, priority right lost, that result from the deficiencies or failure to take appropriate action within due time.

In general, depending on the deficiency in question, either:

(i)a time limit will be specified by the EPO, subject to Rule 132, for meeting the objection, e.g. an invitation to supply the priority document or priority file number under Rule 59 or

(ii)a fixed time limit will apply, e.g. two months for correcting deficiencies under Rule 58.

For further details see E‑VIII, 1. If a deficiency is not rectified in due time, then the legal effects that are envisaged will apply.2. Amendment of application

2.1 Filing of amendments

2.2 Examination of amendments as to formalities2.1 Filing of amendments

Prior to receiving the European search report, the applicant may amend the application only if invited by the Receiving Section to remedy particular deficiencies, including when no claims are present in the application as originally filed. In this case, the applicant must rectify this deficiency by filing a set of claims in response to a communication according to Rule 58 (see A‑III, 15). In the period between receiving the European search report and a first communication from the examining division, i.e. also when the application may still be with the Receiving Section, applicants may of their own volition amend the description, claims and drawings (Rule 137(2)). Where a search opinion accompanies the search report under Rule 62(1), the applicant must respond to it by filing observations and/or amendments (see B‑XI, 8 for details and exceptions to this requirement). However, the European patent application may not be amended in such a way that it contains subject-matter extending beyond the content of the application as filed (regarding the publication of claims thus amended in response to the European search report under Rule 137(2), see also A‑VI, 1.3).

Rule 58 Rule 137(1) and Rule 137(2) Art. 123(1) and Art. 123(2) Rule 68(4)2.2 Examination of amendments as to formalities

The Receiving Section examines amendments, filed before the receipt of the search report, for formal requirements. Such amendments must remedy the deficiencies notified by the Receiving Section. The description, claims and drawings may be amended only to the extent sufficient to remedy the disclosed deficiencies, which makes it necessary for the Receiving Section to compare any amended description, claims and drawings with those originally filed. Where, for example, a fresh description is filed to replace an earlier description that was objected to on account of non-compliance with the physical requirements, the Receiving Section must compare both descriptions, and the objection is not met until the wording is identical. However, identity of wording with the application documents as originally filed is not a requirement for amendments rectifying the following deficiencies:

(i)filing at least one claim according to Rule 58, where no claims existed on filing (see A‑III, 15) (these claims must still satisfy the requirements of Art. 123(2), but this check is carried out by the search and examining divisions)

(ii)the filing of missing parts of the description or missing drawings according to Rule 56 (see A‑II, 5).

Amendments that extend beyond the remedying of deficiencies and that are filed prior to receipt of the search report may be taken into consideration in the subsequent procedure, provided that on receipt of the search report the applicants declare that they wish them to be maintained.

Examination as to formalities of amendments filed after the receipt of the search report and before the application is transferred to the examining division is the responsibility of the Receiving Section.

The procedure for effecting amendments is dealt with in H‑III, 2.

Rule 58 Rule 137(1)3. Correction of errors in documents filed with the EPO

Linguistic errors, errors of transcription and mistakes in any document filed with the EPO may be corrected on request under Rule 139, first sentence. Requests for such corrections may be made at any time, provided that proceedings are pending before the EPO (see J 42/92). However, if the error to be corrected concerns items that third parties might expect to be able to take at face value and whose correction would jeopardise their rights, the request for correction must be filed as soon as possible, and at least in time for incorporation in the publication of the European patent application. With regard to correction of priority claims, specific provisions apply with a view to protecting the interests of third parties and allow the applicant to correct priority claims and lay down a time limit for doing so (see Rule 52(3) and A‑III, 6.5.2). This ensures that corrected priority information is available when the application is published. The applicant can only correct the priority claim after this date, in particular after publication of the application, under certain limited circumstances where it is apparent on the face of the published application that a mistake has been made. See J 2/92, J 3/91 and J 6/91 as well as J 11/92 and J 7/94. Each of these decisions indicated situations under EPC 1973 where the requester could correct priority data even though it was too late for a warning to be published with the application. These same situations apply mutatis mutandis under EPC 2000 to the acceptance of requests to correct priority claims after the end of the time limit according to Rule 52(3). Regarding correction of the date indicated for the previous filing, see also A‑III, 6.6.

Rule 139, 1st sentence

After expiry of the two-month time limit for correcting erroneous (parts) of the application documents under Rule 56a(1) or Rule 56a(3) (see A‑II, 6), the correction of errors in application documents is governed by Rule 139, second sentence. The allowability of such corrections under Rule 139 is subject to strict requirements.

Rule 56a

If the error is in the description, claims or drawings, the correction must be obvious in the sense that it is immediately evident that nothing else could have been intended than what is offered as the correction. Such a correction may be effected only within the limits of what a skilled person would derive directly and unambiguously, using common general knowledge, and seen objectively and relative to the date of filing, from all of the documents as filed (see G 3/89 and G 11/91; see also H‑VI, 2.2.1). The documents to be considered in assessing whether the correction is allowable are those of the application as originally filed, including any late-filed missing parts of the description or missing drawings filed according to Rule 56, or application documents or parts corrected according to Rule 56a, regardless of whether this resulted in a change of the filing date (see A‑II, 5 et seq and A‑II, 6 et seq). However, claims filed after the filing date in response to an invitation according to Rule 58 (see A‑III, 15) cannot be used in assessing the allowability of the request.

It is not allowable under Rule 139 to replace the complete set of application documents (i.e. description, claims and drawings) with other documents that the applicant had intended to file with the request for grant (see G 2/95).

The examining division decides on the request for correction. If such a request is pending before termination of the technical preparations for publication, a reference to it is published on the front page.

In the case of electronic filing of European patent applications, the technical documents (description, claims, abstract and drawings) may be attached in their original format, provided it is one listed in the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 May 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A42 3 May 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A48. Under this decision, these technical documents may also be attached in a format other than those listed, provided that on filing the application the applicant informs the EPO where it can reasonably acquire the corresponding software. If, on the filing date, the documents making up the European patent application are available both in the format provided by the Online Filing software and in another admissible format in accordance with the above decision, the documents in the latter format can also be used to determine whether a request for correction of the description, claims or drawings is allowable.

Rule 139, 2nd sentenceChapter VI – Publication of application; request for examination and transmission of the dossier to examining division

1. Publication of application

2. Request for examination and transmission of the dossier to the examining division

3. Response to the search opinion1. Publication of application

1.1 Date of publication

1.2 No publication; preventing publication

1.3 Content of the publication

1.4 Publication in electronic form only

1.5 Separate publication of the European search report1.1 Date of publication

The application is published as soon as possible after the expiry of a period of 18 months from the filing date or, where priority is claimed, from the earliest priority date. Upon request from the applicant, the application may, however, be published before that date, provided that the filing and search fees have been validly paid and there are no formal deficiencies in the application documents (see A‑III, 1.1 and 16). Deficiencies not yet remedied concerning the designation of inventor are not a bar to early publication (see A‑III, 5.4 and J 1/10). If the application is ready for grant before expiry of the 18-month period, see C‑IV, 7.1 and C‑VI, 3.

If the applicant abandons the priority date, the publication is deferred, provided that the EPO receives the abandonment notification before the technical preparations for publication are completed. These preparations are considered completed at the end of the day that comes five weeks before expiry of the 18th month following the earliest date of priority if priority is claimed, or following the filing date if the priority is abandoned or no priority is claimed (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, D.1). The applicant is informed about the termination of the preparations, the publication number and intended publication date. Where the priority abandonment notification is received after that time, publication, if not already completed, takes place as if the priority date applied, although a notice as to the abandonment of the priority will appear in the European Patent Bulletin (see F‑VI, 3.5). The same procedure is followed when the priority right is lost under Art. 90(5) (see A‑III, 6.10).

Art. 93(1)1.2 No publication; preventing publication

The application is not published if it has been finally refused or deemed withdrawn or withdrawn before the technical preparations for publication are completed (see A‑VI, 1.1). These preparations are considered completed at the end of the day that comes five weeks before expiry of the 18th month following the filing or priority date (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, D.1). The application is, however, published if, upon termination of the preparations, a request for a decision under Rule 112(2) has been received but no final decision has yet been taken (see OJ EPO 1990, 455) or if there is a pending request for re-establishment of rights under Art. 122 and Rule 136(1).

If, after termination of the preparations, the application is withdrawn, non-publication cannot be guaranteed. However, the EPO will endeavour (in accordance with the principles of J 5/81) to prevent publication on a case-by-case basis if the stage reached in the publication procedure permits this without undue effort (see the notice from the EPO dated 25 April 2006, OJ EPO 2006, 406).

Rule 67(2)

The application may be withdrawn by means of a signed declaration, which should be unqualified and unambiguous (see J 11/80). EPO Form 1018, which can be downloaded free of charge from epo.org, ensures that the declaration is unambiguous (also in respect of any conditions for withdrawal). It is therefore highly recommended to use it for withdrawing the European patent application (see also the notice from the EPO dated 12 August 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A79). The applicant is bound by an effective declaration of withdrawal (see C‑V, 11) but may make it subject to the proviso that the content of the application not be made known to the public. This takes into account the procedural peculiarity that the applicant making the declaration of withdrawal less than in the five weeks before the date of publication cannot know whether publication can still be prevented. However, neither the application nor the designation of a contracting state may be withdrawn from the time a third party proves that they have initiated entitlement proceedings and up to the date on which the EPO resumes the proceedings for grant (see also E‑VIII, 8).

Rule 151.3 Content of the publication

The publication must contain the description, the claims and any drawings as filed, including any sequence listing filed on the filing date, including and any late-filed missing parts of the description or missing drawings filed according to Rule 56 Rule 56(2) or (3) (see A‑II, 5), or any correct (parts) of the) application documents according to Rule 56 Rule 56a(3) or (4) (see A‑II, 6 and the notice from the EPO dated 23 June 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A71). Where correct (parts of the) application documents are included under Rule 56a(4), the publication also contains the erroneous (parts of the) application documents – clearly marked as erroneously filed – as the application as filed. Where the procedure under Rule 56 or Rule 56a is not finalised when the technical preparations for publication are terminated, a correction of the publication will be initiated as soon as the filing date and content of the application are finally determined. The publication will also specify, where possible, the person(s) designated as the inventor(s). If the claims were filed after the filing date according to the procedures explained in A‑III, 15, this will be indicated when the application is published (Rule 68(4)).

The publication also indicates as designated contracting states all states party to the EPC on the date the application was filed unless individual states have been withdrawn by the applicant before the termination of the technical preparations for publication. When a European patent application filed before 1 April 2009 is published, the states for which protection is actually sought may not yet be known because the time limit under Rule 39(1) for paying the designation fees is still running. Those definitively designated – through actual payment of designation fees – are announced later in the European Patent Register and the European Patent Bulletin (see Information from the EPO, OJ EPO 1997, 479). For European divisional applications, see A‑IV, 1.3.4.

Rule 68(1), Rule 68(3) and Rule 68(4) Rule 20 Rule 32(1)

The publication also contains any new or amended claims filed by the applicant under Rule 137(2), together with the European search report and the abstract determined by the search division if both are available before the technical preparations for publication are terminated. Otherwise the abstract filed by the applicant is published. The search opinion is not published with the European search report (Rule 62(2)), though it is open to file inspection (see A‑XI, 2.1). If the EPO has received a communication from the applicant under Rule 32(1) ("expert solution"), this too must be mentioned (see the notice from the EPO dated 7 July 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 498). Further data may be included at the discretion of the EPO President.

With the exception of documents that have to be translated, originals of documents filed are used for publication purposes where they meet the physical requirements referred to in A‑VIII, 2; otherwise, the amended or replacement documents meeting these requirements are used. Application documents that are of such bad quality that any improvement would result in an extension of the subject-matter as originally filed are published as filed. Prohibited matter may be omitted from the documents before publication, the place and number of words or drawings omitted being indicated (see A‑III, 8.1 and A‑III, 8.2). Documents incorporated in an electronic file are deemed to be originals (Rule 147(3)).

Rule 68(2) and Rule 68(4) Rule 66

If a request for correction under Rule 139 of errors in the documents filed with the EPO is allowed, it must be incorporated in the publication. If, upon termination of the technical preparations for publication, a decision is still pending on a request for correction of items that third parties might expect to be able to take at face value and whose correction would jeopardise their rights, this must be mentioned on the front page of the publication (see the case law in A‑V, 3), as must a request for correction of errors in the description, claims or drawings (see A‑V, 3).

The correction of errors occurring in the course of the European patent application's publication can be requested at any time (see H‑VI, 3). Complete republication of the application will take place where appropriate.

Rule 1391.4 Publication in electronic form only

All European patent applications, European search reports and European patent specifications are published in electronic form only, on a publication server (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, D.3, and OJ EPO 2005, 126) accessible via the EPO website (epo.org).1.5 Separate publication of the European search report

2.2 Time limit for filing the request for examination

2.3 Legal remedy

2.4 Transmission of the dossier to the examining division

2.5 Refund of examination fee

2.6 Reduction in examination fee2.1 Communication

The Receiving Section communicates to the applicant the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report and draws attention to the provisions with regard to the request for examination as set out in Art. 94(1) and Art. 94(2) and Rule 70(1). In the unlikely event that the communication wrongly specifies a later date than the date of the publication's mention, the later date is decisive as regards the time limit for filing the request for examination (see A‑VI, 2.2 and C‑II, 1) and also for responding to the search opinion (see B‑XI, 8 and A‑VI, 3) unless the error is obvious. In the communication, the applicant is also informed that the designation fee(s) must be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the search report's publication (see A‑III, 11.2 and A-III, 11.3).

Rule 69(1) and Rule 69(2)

Where the time limit under Rule 70(1) is that within which the applicant must reply to the search opinion (i.e. where Rule 70(2) does not apply), the invitation under Rule 70a(1) is sent in a combined communication with the communication according to Rule 69(1) (see C‑II, 3.3).

Rule 70a(1)2.2 Time limit for filing the request for examination

The request for examination may be filed by the applicant up to the end of six months after the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the European search report's publication. The request for examination is not deemed filed until the examination fee has been paid (see C‑II, 1). If the applicant does not file the request for examination and pay the examination fee within the above time limit, then the procedure explained in A‑VI, 2.3 applies.

Art. 94(1) and Art. 94(2) Rule 70(1)

The mandatory request for grant form (EPO Form 1001) contains a written request for examination. To confirm the written request, the applicant only needs to pay the examination fee within the time limit under Rule 70(1).

Art. 78(1)(a) Rule 41(1)

Applicants may also pay the examination fee as from the filing date and prior to receipt of the European search report. In that case, the Receiving Section invites them under Rule 70(2) to indicate within six months of the date of the mention of the search report's publication in the European Patent Bulletin whether they wish to proceed further with their application (see C‑II, 1.1). If, after receipt of the European search report, the applicant decides not to pursue the application and does not react to the invitation under Rule 70(2), the application will be deemed withdrawn under Rule 70(3), and the examination fee will be refunded in its entirety (see A‑VI, 2.5).

Art. 11(a) RFees

If the applicant has filed an automatic debit order, the examination fee will normally be debited at the end of the six-month period. For cases in which the applicant wishes the application to be transmitted earlier to the examining division, see the AAD in Annex A.1 of Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2022.

Point 5.1(c) AAD

The request for examination may not be withdrawn.

Regarding Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase, see E‑IX, 2.1.4 and E‑IX, 2.5.2.

Rule 70(1)2.3 Legal remedy

If the request for examination is not validly filed by paying the examination fee before expiry of the period under Rule 70(1), the application is deemed withdrawn and the applicant is notified accordingly. In response to this loss-of-rights communication, the applicant can request further processing in accordance with Art. 121 and Rule 135 (see E‑VIII, 2).

Art. 94(2) Rule 112(1)

If the applicants have validly filed a request for examination before the European search report has been transmitted to them, the Receiving Section invites them according to Rule 70(2) to indicate within six months of the date of the mention of the search report's publication in the European Patent Bulletin whether they wish to proceed further with their application. If they fail to respond to this request in time, the application is deemed withdrawn and the applicants are notified accordingly. In this case, the applicants may also avail themselves of the legal remedy under Art. 121 and Rule 135 (further processing of the application). Regarding reimbursement of the examination fee, see A‑VI, 2.2 and A‑X, 10.2.3. C‑VI, 3 describes the procedure in respect of a categorical request for examination, as provided for in Rule 10(4), where the applicant waives the right to the communication according to Rule 70(2).

Regarding Euro-PCT applications entering the regional phase, see E‑IX, 2.1.3 and E‑IX 2.5.2.

Rule 70(2) and Rule 70(3) Rule 112(1) Art. 1212.4 Transmission of the dossier to the examining division

If the Receiving Section finds that the request for examination was filed in due time, or the wish to proceed further with the application was indicated in due time (Rule 70(2)), it transmits the application to the examining division. Otherwise, it will notify the applicant of the loss of rights that has occurred (see Rule 112(1)).

The dossier as transmitted to the examining division contains the following:

(i)all documents filed in relation to the application, including priority documents, translations and any amendments

(ii)any certificate filed in relation to display at an exhibition (see A‑IV, 3) and any information furnished under Rule 31 if the application relates to biological material (see A‑IV, 4)

(iii)the European search report, if applicable the search opinion, the content of the abstract as drawn up by the search division and the internal search note, if any

(iv)copies of documents cited in the search report and two copies of the publication document(s)

(v)the applicant's response to the search opinion (see B‑XI, 8) or to the WO‑ISA, supplementary international search report or IPER prepared by the EPO (see E‑IX, 3.2 and E‑IX, 3.3.4)

(vi)all relevant correspondence.

The Receiving Section will direct attention to any aspects of the application requiring urgent attention by the examining division, e.g. any letters that have to be answered before the application is examined in its proper turn.

Art. 16 Art. 18(1) Rule 102.5 Refund of examination fee

The examination fee is refunded:

(i)in full if the European patent application is withdrawn, refused or deemed withdrawn before substantive examination has begun (Art. 11(a) RFees)

(ii)at a rate of 50% if the European patent application is withdrawn after substantive examination has begun and

– before expiry of the (extended) time limit for replying to the first invitation under Art. 94(3) issued by the examining division proper or

– if no such invitation has been issued, before the date of the communication under Rule 71(3) (Art. 11(b) RFees).

As concerns (i) above, this applies to all European patent applications that are withdrawn, refused or deemed withdrawn on or after 1 July 2016. As concerns (ii) above, this applies to all European patent applications for which substantive examination began on or after 1 November 2016 (see the Administrative Council decision of 29 June 2016, OJ EPO 2016, A48). For all applications for which substantive examination began before that date, Art. 11 RFees as in force before 1 November 2016 continues to apply, which means that there will be no refund if the application is withdrawn, refused or deemed withdrawn at this stage of proceedings.

Communications under Art. 94(3) "issued by the examining division proper" (see also C‑III, 4) are all communications indicating that the application does not meet the requirements of the EPC and referring to deemed withdrawal under Art. 94(4) if the deficiencies are not duly remedied. These include the following:

–invitations under Rule 137(4)

– minutes of consultations by phone or in person, accompanied by an invitation to remedy deficiencies

– communications relating to the "completely contained" criterion under Rule 56(3) or Rule 56a(4)

– summonses to oral proceedings under Rule 115(1) to which a communication complying with the requirements of Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) is annexed.

In contrast, communications addressing purely formal deficiencies and issued by formalities officers as part of the duties entrusted to them, even if issued on the basis of Art. 94(3), do not constitute communications under Art. 94(3) "issued by the examining division proper". Likewise, communications issued by the examining division proper on some other legal basis, such as Rule 164(2)(a), Rule 53(3) or Art. 124, have no bearing on the period for a withdrawal qualifying for the 50% refund (see the notice from the EPO dated 30 June 2016, OJ EPO 2016, A49).

An applicant unsure whether substantive examination has begun and wanting to withdraw the application only if certain to receive the 100% refund may make withdrawal contingent upon the refund ("conditional" withdrawal). The date of the start of examination (C‑IV, 7.1) is indicated by means of EPO Form 2095 in the public part of the dossier and is thus open to file inspection in the European Patent Register after the patent application's publication. If EPO Form 2095 is not on file, substantive examination is deemed to have started on the date on which the first communication from the examining division proper is issued (e.g. a communication under Art. 94(3), Rule 71(3) or any other legal basis as mentioned above). Before publication, the applicant can request the relevant information from the EPO or access it electronically via the MyEPO Portfolio and My Files services service. For more details, see OJ EPO 2013, 153, and OJ EPO 2023, A89.

Art. 11 RFees2.6 Reduction in examination fee

Where applicants having their residence or principal place of business within the territory of a contracting state having an official language other than English, French or German and nationals of that state who are resident abroad make use of the options provided for under Art. 14(4), the examination fee is reduced under certain circumstances (Rule 6(3) to Rule 6(7) in conjunction with Art. 14(1) RFees) (see A‑X, 9.2.1 and A-X, 9.2.3).

Art. 14(4) Rule 6 Art. 14(1) RFees3. Response to the search opinion

The applicant is required to respond to the search opinion within the time limit under Rule 70(1) or, if a communication under Rule 70(2) is sent (see C‑II, 1.1), within the time limit under Rule 70(2). If the applicant fails to respond to the search opinion on time, the application is deemed withdrawn (Rule 70a(3)). For more details, see B‑XI, 8.

8. Authentic text of the application or patent1. Admissible languages on filing

1.1 General

1.2 Filing by reference

1.3 European divisional applications; Art. 61 applications

1.4 Invitation to file the translation1.1 General

European patent applications can be filed in any language. However, if filed in a language other than an official EPO language (English, French and German), a translation into one of the official languages must be filed within two months of the date of filing (Rule 6(1)). Although filing in any language is in principle possible, there may be limitations due to the applicable national law for applications filed at a central industrial property office or the competent national authority under Art. 75(1)(b).

Art. 14(1) and Art. 14(2) Rule 6(1)

In the case of applications filed in "an admissible non‑EPO language" (see A‑VII, 3.2), a reduction of the filing fee is allowed for certain categories of applicants (see A‑X, 9.2.1 and A‑X, 9.2.2).

Filing a European patent application in a single language is not a requirement for according a filing date (Art. 90(3) in conjunction with Art. 14(2)). However, where an application is filed in more than one language, the EPO will invite the applicant to remedy the deficiency.

Rule 6(3) to (7)1.2 Filing by reference

Where the description is filed by reference to a previously filed application (see A‑II, 4.1.3.1) and the latter is not in an official EPO language, the applicant must also file a translation into one such language within two months of the filing date.

Rule 40(3)1.3 European divisional applications; Art. 61 applications

European divisional applications must be filed in the language of the proceedings of the earlier (parent) application. Alternatively, if the earlier (parent) application was not in an official EPO language, the divisional application may be filed in the language of the earlier (parent) application. In this case a translation into the language of the proceedings of the earlier application must be filed within two months of the filing of the divisional application.

Rule 36(2)

The same applies to the filing of a new European patent application under Art. 61(1)(b).

Art. 61(2)1.4 Invitation to file the translation

Where the translation is not filed in due time, the EPO will invite the applicant to rectify this deficiency within a non-extendable period of two months. Failure to file the translation in time in response to this invitation results in the application being deemed withdrawn under Art. 14(2), in which case further processing is ruled out (see A‑III, 14).

Art. 90(3) Rules 57 and 582. Language of the proceedings

The official EPO language (English, French or German) in which the application is filed, or into which it is subsequently translated, constitutes the "language of the proceedings". Where the EPO invites the applicant to file the translation (see A‑VII, 1.4), the invitation will be sent by default in English with an update to the language of the proceedings on receipt of the translation, if applicable.

The language of the proceedings is the only language used by EPO departments in written proceedings on that application (see G 4/08).

Art. 14(3)

Where European patent applications are filed in one of the official EPO languages, or after they have been translated into one of them, the description, claims and drawings can only be amended in that official language, which is the language of the proceedings.

Any claims filed after the filing date will need to be filed in the language of the proceedings.

Example: If an application is filed without claims in Japanese and is then translated into English, the claims will need to be filed in English. Subsequent amendments to the application will also have to the filed in English.

Rule 3(2)3. Derogations from the language of the proceedings in written proceedings

3.1 Parties' written submissions

3.2 Admissible non‑EPO languages

3.3 Priority document

3.4 Documents filed as evidence

3.5 Third-party observations3.1 Parties' written submissions

With the exception of amendments to the European patent application or European patent, any party may use any of the EPO's three official languages in written proceedings before the EPO.

Rule 3(1)3.2 Admissible non‑EPO languages

Natural or legal persons having their residence or principal place of business within an EPC contracting state having a language other than English, French or German as an official language, and nationals of that state resident abroad, may file documents that have to be filed within a time limit in an official language of that state ("admissible non‑EPO language"). For example, an Italian or Swiss applicant may file a reply in Italian to a communication from the examining division issued under Art. 94(3).

Art. 14(3) and Art. 14(4)

A translation of a document filed in an admissible non‑EPO language into an official language of the EPO must be filed within a non-extendable period of one month (Rule 6(2)). However, if the document is a notice of opposition or appeal or a petition for review (Art. 112a), the period extends to the end of the opposition or appeal period or the period for petition for review, if this expires later. The translation can be into any of the EPO's official languages, regardless of the language of the proceedings.

Rule 6(2)3.3 Priority document

Where the certified copy of the previous application whose priority is claimed (priority document) is not in an official EPO language, a translation into one such language need only be filed at the invitation of the EPO. This invitation is issued only where the validity of the priority claim is relevant to determining the patentability of the invention concerned. The translation may be replaced by a declaration that the European patent application is a complete translation of the previous invention.

See A‑III, 6.8 for more information on the translation of priority documents.

Rule 53(3)3.4 Documents filed as evidence

Documents to be used as evidence may be filed in any language. This applies to all proceedings before the EPO and, especially, to publications (for instance, an extract from a Korean periodical cited by an opponent to show lack of novelty or lack of inventive step). However, the department dealing with the case may require a translation of the document or relevant parts of it in one of the official EPO languages, to be chosen by the person filing the document. If the document is filed by the applicant in pre-grant proceedings, the EPO should require a translation of the document or relevant parts of it unless the examiners are fully competent in the language concerned. In opposition proceedings the same principles apply, taking into account the interests of all parties. The time limit for filing the translation will be specified by the competent EPO department on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the language concerned and the length of the document or relevant parts, taking account of the provisions of Rule 132 (see E‑VIII, 1.2). If the required translation is not filed in due time, the EPO may disregard the document in question.

Rule 3(3)3.5 Third-party observations

Third-party observations (E‑VI, 3) must be filed in writing and in one of the EPO's official languages. Supporting documents, e.g. prior-art citations, can be written in any language.

If the third-party observations and/or prior art are not in an official EPO language (Art. 14(1)), the EPO may invite the third party, if identifiable, to submit a translation of the observations and, where appropriate, of the cited prior art in one such language within a period according to Rule 132.

Rule 114(1)4. Derogations from the language of the proceedings in oral proceedings

This subject is dealt with in E‑V.

Rule 45. Documents filed in the wrong language

Documents making up the European patent application can only be filed in the wrong language on the occasion of its amendment, since the application can originally be filed in any language (see A‑VII, 1.1). In such a case, as well as if any other document is not filed in the prescribed language or any required translation is not filed in due time, the document is deemed not filed. The person who has filed the document will be notified accordingly by the EPO. Even though deemed not filed, the document concerned will become part of the file and therefore accessible to the public according to Art. 128(4).

Art. 14(1)

In the event of failure to file a translation of the filed documentary evidence upon invitation in due time, the documents in question may be disregarded by the EPO.

Where submissions accompanying the performance of a procedural act subject to a time limit (e.g. filing the designation of the inventor, filing a certified copy of the earlier application for which priority is claimed or filing the translation of the priority document under Rule 53(3)) are not filed in an official EPO language, they will be included in the file without note being taken of their content.

Rule 3(3)

Observations by third parties and notices of oppositions will be communicated to the applicant or the patent proprietor even if they are deemed not filed.

Rules 79(1) and 114(2)6. Languages of publication

European patent applications are published only in the language of the proceedings, whereas European patent specifications are published in the language of the proceedings together with translations of the claims in the other two official languages.

Art. 14(5) and (6)7. Correction and certification of the translation

Any error in the translation filed can be corrected at any time during proceedings before the EPO, i.e. during pre-grant proceedings and also during opposition proceedings, bringing the translation into conformity with the application as filed in the original language (e.g. with the originally filed Japanese-language application). This applies similarly to translations filed for Euro-PCT applications upon entry into the European phase (see E‑IX, 2.1.2). However, correction of the translation during opposition proceedings will not be allowed if it contravenes Art. 123(3), i.e. if it implies an amendment of the claims that extends the protection conferred.

Art. 14(2)

Unless evidence is provided to the contrary, the EPO will assume, for the purposes of determining whether the subject-matter of the European patent application or European patent extends beyond the content of the application as filed (Art. 123(2)), that the translation filed under Art. 14(2) or Rule 40(3) is in conformity with the original text of the application (e.g. in Japanese). The text of the application as filed however remains the basis for determining the allowability of amendments under Art. 123(2) or the content of the disclosure for the purposes of Art. 54(3) (see G‑IV, 5.1).

Rule 7 Art. 70(2)

The EPO has the discretion to require the filing of a certificate that a translation supplied corresponds to the original text, within a period to be specified (see E‑VIII, 1.2 and E‑VIII, 1.6). An invitation to file the certificate may only be made where the EPO has serious doubts as to the accuracy of the translation. Failure to file the certificate in due time will lead to the document being deemed not received unless the EPC provides otherwise. Further processing is possible according to Art. 121 and Rule 135.

As a rule, certification is not required in respect of the translations of the claims in the other two official languages required under Rule 71(3).

Rule 58. Authentic text of the application or patent

The text of an application or patent in the language of the proceedings is the authentic text. It therefore follows that the translation of the claims of the patent specification required by Art. 14(6) is for information only.

1. Representation

2. Form of documents

3. Signature of documents1. Representation

1.1 General principles

1.2 Representation by a professional representative; list of professional representatives; associations

1.3 Representation by an employee

1.4 Common representative

1.5 Representation by a legal practitioner

1.6 Signed authorisation

1.7 General authorisation

1.8 Invitation to file authorisation and legal consequence in case of non-compliance1.1 General principles

Subject to the next sentence, no person may be compelled to be represented by a professional representative in proceedings before the EPO; this holds for all parties to such proceedings, e.g. applicants, proprietors, opponents. A party (natural or legal person) who has neither residence nor principal place of business in a contracting state must be represented by a professional representative; the party must act through a professional representative in all proceedings other than in filing the application (which includes all acts leading to the assignment accordance of a date of filing) or initiating the European phase within the applicable time limit (see E‑IX, 2.3.1). To "be represented" is to be interpreted as meaning due representation, including not only notice of the appointment of a professional representative but also, where applicable, the filing of authorisations of the appointed representative (see A‑VIII, 1.6).

Parties having their residence or principal place of business in a contracting state may also act direct before the EPO, even if they have appointed a professional representative (see A‑VIII, 1.2), an employee (see A‑VIII, 1.3) or a legal practitioner (see A‑VIII, 1.5) to act on their behalf. When conflicting instructions are received from parties and their representative, each will be advised of the other's action.

Should opponents who are party to proceedings and do not have either residence or principal place of business within the territory of one of the contracting states fail to meet the requirement set out under Art. 133(2) in the course of the opposition procedure (e.g. the representative withdraws from the opposition case or is deleted from the list of professional representatives), they are requested to appoint a new representative. Irrespective of whether they do so, the EPO will nevertheless inform opponents of the date and location of any oral proceedings and point out that if they appear alone they will not be entitled to act before the division.

Art. 133(1) and Art. 133(2) Art. 90(3) Rule 1521.2 Representation by a professional representative; list of professional representatives; associations

Representation of natural or legal persons in proceedings before the EPO may only be undertaken by professional representatives whose names appear on a list kept for this purpose by the EPO. See, however, also A‑VIII, 1.5. The Legal Division has sole responsibility for entries and deletions in the list of professional representatives (see Art. 20(1) and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 21 November 2013, OJ EPO 2013, 600). A group of at least two professional representatives registered with the EPO under the name of as an association within the meaning of Rule 152(11) may be appointed collectively to represent a party under that name (see OJ EPO 2013, 535). In that case, each member of the association may perform procedural acts on behalf of the party, while correspondence from the EPO, according to Rule 130, is addressed to the association rather than one particular member. Parties are recommended to clearly specify whether they wish to appoint the association or an individual representative belonging to that association (see also A‑VIII, 1.7). The Legal Division is responsible for the registration of associations (OJ EPO 2013, 600).

Art. 134(1), Rule 152(11)1.3 Representation by an employee

Parties having their residence or principal place of business in a contracting state are not obliged to be represented by a professional representative in proceedings before the EPO. They may, irrespective of whether they are legal or natural persons, act through an employee, who need not be a professional representative but who must be authorised always file an authorisation (see A‑VIII, 1.6, and A‑VIII, 1.7).

Art. 133(3) Art. 134(1) Rule 1521.4 Common representative

Joint applicants, joint proprietors of patents and more than one person giving joint notice of opposition or intervention may act through a common representative. If the request for the grant of a European patent, the notice of opposition or the request for intervention does not name a common representative, the party first named in the relevant document will be considered the common representative. The common representative can thus be a legal person. However, if one of the parties is obliged to appoint a professional representative and has done so, this representative will be considered the common representative acting on behalf of all parties. In such a case, no other party can act as common representative. However, if the first named party in the document has appointed a professional representative, that representative will be considered to be acting on behalf of all parties.

If the European patent application or patent is transferred to more than one person, and such persons have not appointed a common representative, the preceding provisions will apply. If such application is not possible, the EPO will require the parties to appoint a common representative within a two-month period specified by the EPO (see E‑VIII, 1.6). If this request is not complied with, the EPO will appoint the common representative (J 10/96).

In the case of joint applicants for whom a change of representative is requested, any authorisation must be signed by all applicants. If this is not the case, the parties will likewise be invited to appoint a common representative before registration can take place.

For Rule 151 to apply, each party or their duly authorised representative must have signed the document (request for grant, notice of opposition, etc.) giving rise to their participation (see also A‑III, 4.2.2 and A‑VIII, 3.2 and A-VIII, 3.4). Otherwise the party cannot take part in the proceedings, nor therefore be represented by a common representative.

Art. 133(4) Rule 151(1) and (2)1.5 Representation by a legal practitioner

Representation in proceedings under the EPC may also be undertaken in the same way as by a professional representative (see A‑VIII, 1.2) by any legal practitioner qualified in one of the contracting states and having their place of business within such state, to the extent that they are entitled, within the said state, to act as a professional representative in patent matters. Legal practitioners entitled to act as representatives before the EPO are not entered on the list of professional representatives (see J 18/99). However, they are registered in an internal database administered by the Legal Division (see OJ EPO 2013, 600).

Art. 134(1) and Art. 134(8)1.6 Signed authorisation

Representatives acting before the EPO must, on request, file a signed authorisation (see A‑VIII, 3.2) within a two-month period specified by the EPO (see E‑VIII, 1.6). Both individual and general authorisations (see A‑VIII, 1.7) within the meaning of Rule 152(4) serve the same purpose. For general authorisations, the indication of the registration number is equivalent to the filing of the authorisation itself. The filing of an authorisation is distinct from the appointment of a representative for a specific case. If the requirements of Art. 133(2) are not fulfilled, the same period will be specified for the communication of the appointment and, where applicable, for the filing of the authorisation.

Professional representatives who identify themselves as such will be required to file a signed authorisation only in certain cases, in particular if there is a change of representative (see Art. 1(2) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, L.1). No authorisation is required where a professional representative other than the appointed one (and not being a member of the same association or law firm) performs a procedural act on behalf of a party to proceedings, e.g. filing a reply to the communication under Rule 71(3), provided that it is apparent from the submission that they are acting at the request of that party without the intention to take over representation. In case of doubt as to a professional representative's entitlement to act on behalf of a party, the EPO may require the filing of an authorisation (see Art. 1(3) of the above decision).

However, a legal practitioner entitled to act as a professional representative in accordance with Art. 134(8) or an employee acting for an applicant in accordance with Art. 133(3), first sentence, but who is not a professional representative, must always file a signed authorisation (see Art. 2 and Art. 3 of the above decision) to be in a position to validly perform procedural acts. In Euro-PCT proceedings, persons representing clients applicants in these capacities are not required to file signed authorisations if they have already filed an authorisation expressly covering proceedings established by the EPC with the EPO as receiving Office, ISA or IPEA. Where a representative is appointed to act on behalf of the applicant in several of that party's applications, it is not necessary to file an individual authorisation for each application (see A‑VIII, 2.4). A clear indication of the applications concerned is sufficient; the EPO will make sure that a copy of the authorisation is included in all of the files concerned.

The authorisation can also be filed by the applicant. This also applies where the applicant is obliged to be represented, as fulfilling the requirement to be represented is not itself a procedural step under Art. 133(2) to which the rule of obligatory representation applies.

An association of representatives can be authorised to represent a party before the EPO within the meaning of Art. 134(1) (Rule 152(11)). A party appointing several representatives can authorise them collectively as an association instead of having to do so individually, provided that the association in question is registered with the EPO (OJ EPO 2013, 535). Where invited to file an authorisation by way of an exception, a reference to that registration number in the authorisation will suffice.

An authorisation remains in force until its termination is communicated to the EPO. Transfer of representation or termination of authorisation can, subject to certain conditions, be effected electronically by the representative using the My Files service (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 26 April 2012, OJ EPO 2012, 352). The authorisation will not terminate upon the death of the person who gave it unless the authorisation provides to the contrary (Rule 152(9)).

Rule 1521.7 General authorisation

An authorisation may cover more than one application or patent. Also, a general authorisation enabling a representative to act in respect of all the patent transactions of the party making the authorisation may be filed. However, an authorisation given for EP proceedings (EPO Form 1004) does not extend to UP proceedings unless this is indicated by selecting the corresponding box on EPO Form 1004. Alternatively, a separate general authorisation solely for UP proceedings may be used (EPO Form 7004). A corresponding procedure applies to the withdrawal of an authorisation.

However, the filing of a general authorisation is distinct from the appointment of a representative for a specific case. The party granting a general authorisation is not bound to appoint one of the representatives listed in any specific procedure before the EPO. Nor does a general authorisation allow the EPO to assume, without any additional information, that a person listed should be appointed as a representative in a specific case (see J 17/98). Therefore, in a specific case, a party wishing to appoint the representative(s) listed in a general authorisation must notify the EPO accordingly by referring to the general authorisation number already registered. The Legal Division is responsible for the registration of general authorisations (OJ EPO 2013, 600).

Art. 133(2) Rule 152(2), Rule 152(4), Rule 152(7), Rule 152(8) and Rule 152(9)1.8 Invitation to file authorisation and legal consequence in case of non-compliance

Where the appointment of a legal practitioner entitled to act as professional representative in accordance with Art. 134(8), or an employee acting for an applicant in accordance with Art. 133(3), first sentence, but who is not a professional representative, is communicated to the EPO without an authorisation being filed, the representative is invited to file the authorisation within a two-month period specified by the EPO (see E‑VIII, 1.6). Where a party having neither residence nor principal place of business within a contracting state has failed to fulfil the requirements of Art. 133(2) (see A‑VIII, 1.1), the invitation will be sent direct to the party concerned. The same period will be specified for the communication of the appointment and, where applicable, the filing of the authorisation. The period may be extended in accordance with Rule 132 on request by the representative or party as the case may be (see E‑VIII, 1.6). If such authorisation is not filed in due time, any procedural steps taken by the representative other than filing a European patent application or initiating the European phase within the applicable time limit (see E‑IX, 2.3.1) will, without prejudice to any other legal consequences provided for in the EPC, be deemed not taken. The party is informed accordingly.

Rule 152(2) and Rule 152(6) Rule 1322. Form of documents

2.1 Documents making up the European patent application

2.2 Replacement documents and translations

2.3 Other documents

2.4 Number of copies

2.5 Filing of subsequent documents2.1 Documents making up the European patent application

The physical requirements that the documents making up the European patent application, i.e. request, description, claims, drawings and abstract, must satisfy are set out in Rule 49(2) in conjunction with the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 (OJ EPO 2022, A113). In particular, when amending the application documents, amendments must be typed. Any submissions containing handwritten amendments to application documents – unless they involve graphic symbols and characters and chemical and mathematical formulae – are a formal deficiency (see Art. 2(7) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 and Rule 50(1)). The EPO President may lay down further special formal or technical requirements for the filing of documents, in particular with regard to the filing of documents by means of electronic communication (Rule 2(1)). Notes on the preparation of OCR-readable patent applications are published in OJ EPO 1993, 59. The particular requirements relating to drawings are dealt with in A‑IX.2.2 Replacement documents and translations

Replacement documents and translations in an official language of documents filed under the provisions of Art. 14(2) or Rule 40(3) are subject to the same requirements as the documents making up the application.

Rule 49(1) Rule 50(1)2.3 Other documents

Documents other than those referred to in the previous paragraphs should be typewritten or printed with a left margin of about 2.5 cm on each page (Art. 3 of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A113).

Rule 50(2)2.4 Number of copies

Documents relating to more than one application or patent (e.g. individual or general authorisation) or having to be communicated to more than one party, only need to be filed in one copy (see also A‑VIII, 1.5). However, in the case of letters accompanying submitted documents (in particular EPO Form 1038), a separate copy must be filed for each file to which the document they accompany relates.

For example, where two different applications share a common priority claim, the applicant only needs to file one copy of the priority document, but this must be accompanied by two different letters each relating to one or the other application (preferably two copies of EPO Form 1038). Each letter (or EPO Form 1038) must be duly signed and indicate one or the other of the two application numbers in respect of which the priority document is being filed (see also A‑VIII, 3.1).2.5 Filing of subsequent documents

After a European patent application has been filed, the documents referred to in Rule 50 may be filed by delivery by hand, by postal services (see A‑II, 1.2 A‑II, 1.1) or by means of electronic communication (see A‑II, 1.1 A‑II, 1.2). These include filing electronically by means of EPO Online Filing, Online Filing 2.0, the EPO web-form filing service, the EPO Contingency Upload Service or, for certain procedural actions, MyEPO Portfolio (see A‑II, 1.1.1) and by fax (see A‑II, 1.1.2 A‑II, 1.2.1). and in electronic form by means of EPO Online Filing, Online Filing 2.0 and the EPO web-form filing service (see A‑II, 1.2.2). Authorisations and priority documents are, however, excluded from filing by fax or using the EPO web-form filing service. Priority documents are excluded from filing by fax, using the EPO web-form filing service or the EPO Contingency Upload Service. For the means of filing accepted for priority documents, see A‑III, 6.7.

The EPO web-form filing service must not be used to file any documents in respect of opposition, limitation and revocation proceedings as well as appeal proceedings and proceedings for review by the Enlarged Board of Appeal (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 May 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A42 3 May 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A48).

If subsequent documents relating to European patent applications are filed by fax, written confirmation reproducing the contents of those documents and complying with the requirements of the Implementing Regulations to the EPC must be supplied on invitation from the EPO within two months of the invitation's notification. If the applicant fails to comply with this request in time, the fax is deemed not to have been received (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 20 February 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A18).

Written confirmation is requested if the documents communicated by fax are of inferior quality.

Rule 2(1)

If, in a fax, a party avails itself of Art. 14(4), the subsequent copy must be filed in the same language as the fax, in which case the copy is deemed received on the fax's filing date. The period under Rule 6(2) for filing the translation under Art. 14(4) begins on the day following the fax's filing date.

Subsequent documents may not be filed on diskette, by email or similar means (see also the notice dated 12 September 2000 concerning correspondence with the Office via email, OJ EPO 2000, 458). However, during telephone consultations and during interviews and oral proceedings held by videoconference, documents filed subsequently as referred to in Rule 50, including authorisations, must be filed by email (for more details see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 13 May 2020, OJ EPO 2020, A71; see also E‑III, 8.5.2).

Art. 14(4) Rule 6(2)3. Signature of documents

3.1 Documents filed after filing the European patent application

3.2 Documents forming part of the European patent application

3.3 Form of signature

3.4 Joint applicants3.1 Documents filed after filing the European patent application

All documents, other than annexes, filed after filing the European patent application must be signed by the person responsible. Under Art. 133, only the applicant or the authorised representative may act in the European patent grant procedure (see A‑VIII, 1.6). Documents filed after filing the European patent application may therefore be effectively signed only by these persons.

Documents such as the priority document or its translation must be accompanied by a cover letter or at least bear a note on the document itself addressed to the EPO and duly signed by a person authorised to act before the EPO. This also applies, for example, to the designation of inventor if this has been signed by an applicant with neither residence nor principal place of business in one of the EPC contracting states. As regards the authorisation, see A‑VIII, 1.6. The signature of the entitled person confirming performance of a written act of procedure helps to clarify the state of the proceedings. It shows whether the act of procedure has been validly performed and also prevents circumvention of the provisions relating to representation. EPO Form 1038 (letter accompanying subsequently filed items) may also be used as a separate letter. A separate form must be used for each file (see the notice from the EPO dated 8 November 1990, OJ EPO 1991, 64). The same applies when, instead of using EPO Form 1038, the applicant submits an accompanying letter with the document in question (see also A‑VIII, 2.4). In the case of electronic filing, several documents for a file can be attached to a single EPO Form 1038E.

EPO Form 1037 can be used for the subsequent filing on paper, at the same time, of items relating to several applications, but without signature. EPO Form 1037 is merely an acknowledgment. Its use is particularly recommended for subsequent filing of documents already bearing the required signature (such as replies to communications).

Rule 50(3) Art. 133

Submissions filed electronically must be signed by an entitled person, although they may be transmitted using a smart card issued to another person. If the signature is omitted on a document not falling within the meaning of A‑VIII, 3.2, the EPO must invite the party concerned to sign it within a fixed time limit. This also applies if the document in question bears the signature of an unentitled person (e.g. the secretary of an authorised representative), a deficiency which for the purposes of the time limits under way is treated as equivalent to omission of the signature of an entitled person. If signed in due time, the document retains its original date of receipt; otherwise it is deemed not received. Likewise, documents filed electronically must be signed by an entitled person, although they may be transmitted using a smart card issued to another person. See also A‑VIII, 3.2 below.

Rule 50(3)3.2 Documents forming part of the European patent application

In addition to the documents referred to in A‑VIII, 3.1, certain documents forming part of the application must be signed. These include the request for grant, the designation of the inventor and, where applicable, the authorisation of a representative. If a European patent application is filed electronically, a facsimile image of the signer's handwritten signature, a text-string signature or an enhanced electronic signature, as applicable, may be used to sign the above documents (Art. 12 of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 May 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A42 3 May 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A48).

With the exception of the authorisation of a representative, the documents may be signed by an authorised representative instead of the applicant.3.3 Form of signature

If documents are filed electronically using EPO Online Filing, the signature may take the form of a facsimile signature, a text-string signature or an enhanced electronic signature. Where documents are filed using Online Filing 2.0, the EPO web-form filing service or the EPO Contingency Upload Service, the signature may take the form of a facsimile signature or a text-string signature. Procedural actions performed in MyEPO Portfolio require a signature in the form of a text string (see OJ EPO 2023, A89).

A facsimile signature is a reproduction of the filing person's signature. A text-string signature is a string of characters, preceded and followed by a forward slash (/), selected by the signatory to prove their identity and intent to sign. An enhanced electronic signature is an electronic signature issued or accepted by the EPO (see OJ EPO 2023, A48).

For signatures accepted on electronically filed assignment documents, see E‑XIV, 3.

Where a document is filed by fax, the reproduction on the fax of the signature of the person filing the document will be considered sufficient. The name and position of that person must be clear from the signature (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 20 February 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A18).

Where a document is filed on paper, a A rubber stamp impression of a party's name, whether a natural or legal person, must be accompanied by a personal signature. Initials or other abbreviated forms will not be accepted as a signature. Where the party concerned is a legal person, a document may in general be signed by any person who purports to sign on behalf of that legal person. The entitlement of a person signing on behalf of a legal person is not checked by the EPO, except where there is reason to believe that the person signing is not authorised and in that case evidence of authority to sign should be called for.

Where a document is filed by fax, the reproduction on the fax of the signature of the person filing the document will be considered sufficient. The name and position of that person must be clear from the signature (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 20 February 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A18).

If documents are filed electronically using EPO Online Filing, the signature may take the form of a facsimile signature, a text-string signature or an enhanced electronic signature. Where documents are filed using Online Filing 2.0 or the EPO web-form filing service, the signature may take the form of a facsimile signature or a text-string signature. A facsimile signature is a reproduction of the filing person's signature. A text string signature is a string of characters, preceded and followed by a forward slash (/), selected by the signatory to prove their identity and intent to sign. An enhanced electronic signature is an electronic signature issued or accepted by the EPO (see OJ EPO 2021, A42).

For signatures accepted on electronically filed assignment documents, see E‑XIV, 3.3.4 Joint applicants

If there is more than one applicant (see A‑VIII, 1.3), each applicant or their appointed representative must sign the request for grant and, where applicable, the appointment of the common representative. This also applies if one of the applicants is considered the common representative under Rule 151(1), first sentence. However, the common representative may sign the designation of inventor and all documents filed after the filing of the application under Rule 50(3). Authorisations on behalf of more than one applicant must be signed by all applicants.

Rule 151(1)Chapter IX – Drawings

This chapter deals with the requirements to be met by drawings contained in the application or patent. Guidance on the presentation of application documents, including drawings, is provided in the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 (OJ EPO 2022, A113, Rule 49(2)), which is the legal basis for the practice described below.

11. Graphic forms of presentation not considered as drawings1. Graphic forms of presentation considered as drawings

1.1 Technical drawings

1.2 Photographs1.1 Technical drawings

All types of technical drawings are considered drawings within the meaning of the EPC; these include, for instance, perspectives, exploded views, sections and cross-sections, details on a different scale, etc. Drawings also cover "flow sheets and diagrams", which include functional diagrams and graphic representations of a given phenomenon expressing the relationship between two or more magnitudes.

Other graphic forms of presentation – chemical and mathematical formulae and tables – may also be included in the description, claims or abstract but are not subject to the same requirements as drawings (see Art. 2(8) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022). These are dealt with in A‑IX, 11. If they are nevertheless submitted as drawings, they are subject to the same requirements as drawings.1.2 Photographs

The EPC makes no express provision for photographs; they are nevertheless allowed where it is impossible to present in a drawing what is to be shown and provided that they are directly reproducible and fulfil the applicable requirements for drawings (e.g. paper size, margins, etc.). Colour photographs can be submitted but will be scanned, printed and made available via file inspection only in black and white. If colours are necessary for discerning details of the photographs submitted, these details may be lost when the photograph is made available in black and white via publication and file inspection. See also A‑IX, 7.1.

Photographs (or their copies) are to be numbered like drawings and briefly described in the description (Rule 42(1)(d)).2. Representation of drawings

2.1 Grouping of drawings

2.2 Reproducibility of drawings

2.3 Figure accompanying the abstract2.1 Grouping of drawings

All drawings must be grouped together on the sheets specifically intended for drawings and may not be included in the description, claims or abstract, even if these finish at the top of a page or leave sufficient room, and even if there is only one figure.

OJ EPO 2022, A1132.2 Reproducibility of drawings

The drawings must be presented in such a way as to allow their electronic or direct reproduction by scanning, photography, electrostatic processes, photo offset and microfilming in an unlimited number of copies.

Rule 49(2)2.3 Figure accompanying the abstract

As regards the figure, or exceptionally figures, to accompany the abstract in a European patent application containing drawings, see A‑III, 10.3 and F‑II, 2.3 and F-II, 2.4. The figure(s) illustrating the abstract must be the figure(s) most representative of the invention and must be chosen from the drawings accompanying the application. It is therefore not permissible to draw a special figure for the abstract that differs from the other figures in the application.3. Conditions if drawings are filed on paper regarding the paper used

In the case of paper filings, drawings must be on sheets of A4 paper (29.7 cm x 21 cm) which must be pliable, strong, white, smooth, matt and durable (recommended paper weight: 80-120 g/m2, see OJ EPO 1994, 74).

All sheets must be free from cracks, creases and folds. Only one side of the sheet may be used. The use of card is not allowed.

Each sheet must be reasonably free from erasures and must be free from alterations. Non-compliance with this rule may be authorised if the authenticity of the content is not in question and the requirements for good reproduction are not in jeopardy.

Any corrections made must be durable and permanent so that they cannot give rise to any doubt. Special products for corrections, such as white masking fluid, may be used, provided they are indelible and comply with the other requirements of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022.

The sheets must be connected in such a way that they can easily be turned over, separated and joined together again.

Permanent fastenings (for example, crimped eyelets) are not permitted. Only temporary fastenings (staples, paper clips and grips, etc.) that leave only slight marks in the margin may be used.

OJ EPO 2022, A1134. Presentation of the sheets of drawings

4.1 Usable surface area of sheets

4.2 Numbering of sheets of drawings4.1 Usable surface area of sheets

On sheets containing drawings, the usable surface area may not exceed 26.2 cm x 17 cm. These sheets may not contain frames round the usable or used surface. The minimum margins are as follows: top side: 2.5 cm; left side: 2.5 cm; right side: 1.5 cm; bottom 1 cm.4.2 Numbering of sheets of drawings

All sheets making up the European patent application must be numbered in consecutive Arabic numerals. These must be centred at the top of the sheet but not in the top margin.

The numbering on sheets of drawings must be positioned within the maximum usable surface area as defined in Art. 1(1) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022. Instead of appearing in the middle of the sheet, the numbering may, however, be positioned towards the right-hand side if the drawing comes too close to the middle of the edge of the usable surface. This numbering should be clear, for example in numbers larger than those used for reference numbers.

All application sheets must be numbered consecutively. The application consists of all the following documents: the request, the description, the claims, the drawings and the abstract. The numbering should preferably be effected using three separate series of numbering, each beginning with one. The first series applies to the request only and is already printed on the form to be used. The second series commences with the first sheet of the description and continues through the claims until the last sheet of the abstract. The third series applies only to the sheets of the drawings and commences with the first sheet of such drawings.

There are no objections to including the description, claims, abstract and drawings in one series of numbering beginning with one. The series of numbering must then commence with the first sheet of the description.5. General layout of drawings

The various figures on the same sheet of drawings must be laid out according to certain requirements as to page-setting and numbering, and figures divided into several parts must comply with particular requirements.

5.1 Page‑setting

5.2 Numbering of figures

5.3 Whole figure5.1 Page‑setting

As far as possible all figures of the drawings should be set out upright on the sheets. If a figure is broader than it is high, it may be set out so that the top and bottom of the figure lie along the sides of the sheet with the top of the figure on the left side of the sheet.

In this case, if other figures are drawn on the same sheet, they should be set out in the same way, so that all the figures on a single sheet lie along parallel axes.

Where the sheet has to be turned in order to read the figures, the numbering should appear on the right-hand side of the sheet.5.2 Numbering of figures

The different figures must be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals, independently of the numbering of the sheets.

This numbering should be preceded by the abbreviation "FIG", whatever the official language of the application. Where a single figure is sufficient to illustrate the invention, it should not be numbered and the abbreviation "FIG" must not appear. This also applies to numbers and letters identifying the figures, i.e. they must be simple and clear and may not be used in association with brackets, circles or inverted commas. They should also be larger than the numbers used for reference signs.

An exception to the above may be permitted only as regards partial figures intended to form one whole figure, irrespective of whether they appear on one or several sheets. In this case the whole figure may be identified by the same number followed by a capital letter (e.g. FIG 7A, FIG 7B).5.3 Whole figure

Where figures drawn on two or more sheets are intended to form one whole figure, the figures on the various sheets must be so arranged that the whole figure can be assembled without concealing any part of the partial figures.

Partial figures drawn on separate sheets must always be capable of being linked edge to edge, that is to say no figure may contain parts of another.

The case may arise where the parts of a whole figure are drawn on a single sheet following a layout different from that of the whole figure, e.g. a very long figure divided into several parts placed one above the other and not next to one another on a sheet. This practice is permitted. However, the relationship between the different figures must be clear and unambiguous. It is therefore recommended that a scaled-down figure be included showing the whole formed by the partial figures and indicating the positions of the sections shown.6. Prohibited matter

The provisions on the omission of prohibited matter within the meaning of Rule 48(1)(a) (see A‑III, 8.1 and F‑II, 7.2) also apply to drawings.

Rule 48(1) and Rule 48(2)

Statements or other matter of the type referred to in Rule 48(1)(c) (see F‑II, 7.4) that are likely to appear in drawings are, in particular, various kinds of advertising, e.g. where the applicant includes in the drawing obvious business or departmental markings or a reference to an industrial design or model, whether registered or not. Doing so introduces matter that is clearly irrelevant or unnecessary, which is expressly prohibited by Rule 48.

Rule 48(1)(c)7. Executing of drawings

7.1 Drawings of lines and strokes

7.2 Shading

7.3 Cross-sections

7.4 Scale of drawings

7.5 Numbers, letters and reference signs

7.6 Variations in proportions7.1 Drawings of lines and strokes

The decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 sets certain standards for lines and strokes in the drawing to permit satisfactory reproduction by the various means described in Art. 2 of that decision.

The drawings must be executed in black. Colour drawings can be submitted but will be scanned, printed and made available via file inspection in black and white only (see also A‑IX, 1.2 in respect of colour photographs). In respect of the content of priority documents issued by the EPO in such a case, see A‑XI, 5.2.

In all cases the thickness of the lines and strokes must take into account the scale, nature, execution and perfect legibility of the drawing and of the reproductions.

All lines must be drawn with the aid of drafting instruments save those for which no instrument exists, e.g. irregular diagrams and structures.7.2 Shading

The use of shading in figures is allowed provided it assists in their understanding and is not so extensive as to impede legibility.7.3 Cross-sections

7.3.1 Sectional diagrams

7.3.2 Hatching7.3.1 Sectional diagrams

Where the figure is a cross-section on another figure, the latter should indicate the position and may indicate the viewing direction.

Each sectional figure should be capable of being quickly identified, especially where several cross-sections are made on the same figure, e.g. by inscribing the words "Section on AB", or to avoid the use of lettering, by marking each end of the cross-section line on the diagram with a single Roman numeral. This number will be the same as the (Arabic) numeral identifying the figure where the section is illustrated. For example: "Figure 22 illustrates a section taken along the line XXII-XXII of Figure 21".7.3.2 Hatching

A cross-section must be set out and drawn in the same manner as a normal view whose parts in cross-section are hatched with regularly spaced strokes, the space between strokes being chosen on the basis of the total area to be hatched.

Hatching should not impede the clear reading of the reference signs and leading lines. Consequently, if it is not possible to place references outside the hatched area, the hatching may be broken off wherever references are inserted. Certain types of hatching may be given a specific meaning.7.4 Scale of drawings

If the scale of the figure is such that all essential details would not be clearly distinguished when reproduced electronically or photographically with a linear reduction in size to two-thirds, then the figure must be redrawn to a larger scale, and if necessary the figure should be split up into partial figures so that a linear reduction in size to two-thirds is still intelligible.

The graphic representation of the scale of drawings in cases where its inclusion is considered useful must be such that it is still usable when the drawing is reproduced in reduced format. This excludes indications of size such as "actual size" or "scale ½", both on the drawings and in the description, in favour of graphic representations of the scale.7.5 Numbers, letters and reference signs

Numbers, letters and reference signs and any other data given on the sheets of drawings, such as the numbering of figures, pages of the drawing, acceptable text matter, graduations on scales, etc., must be simple and clear, and not used in association with any brackets, inverted commas, circles or outlines whatsoever. Signs such as 6' and 35" are not regarded as including inverted commas and are therefore permitted.

Numbers, letters and reference signs should preferably all be laid out the same way up as the diagram to avoid having to rotate the page.

7.5.1 Leading lines

7.5.2 Arrows

7.5.3 Height of the numbers and letters in the drawings

7.5.4 Consistent use of reference signs in description, claims and drawings

7.5.5 Consistent use of reference signs in drawings7.5.1 Leading lines

Leading lines are lines between reference signs and the details referred to. Such lines may be straight or curved and should be as short as possible. They must originate in the immediate proximity of the reference sign and extend at least as far as the features indicated.

Leading lines must be executed in the same way as lines in the drawing in accordance with Art. 1(2)(a) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022.7.5.2 Arrows

Arrows may be used at the end of the leading lines, provided that their meaning is clear. They may indicate a number of points:

(i)a freestanding arrow indicates the entire section towards which it points

(ii)an arrow touching a line indicates the surface shown by the line looking along the direction of the arrow.7.5.3 Height of the numbers and letters in the drawings

A minimum size of 0.32 cm is required for all numbers and letters used on the drawings so that their reduction in size to two-thirds remains easily legible.

The Latin alphabet should normally be used for letters. The Greek alphabet is to be accepted however where it is customarily used, e.g. to indicate angles, wavelengths, etc.7.5.4 Consistent use of reference signs in description, claims and drawings

Reference signs not mentioned in the description and claims may not appear in the drawing, and vice versa.

Reference signs appearing in the drawing must be given in the description and the claims taken as a whole. As regards use of these signs in the claims, see F‑IV, 4.18.

Features of a drawing should not be designated by a reference in cases where the feature itself has not been described. This situation may arise as a result of amendments to the description involving the deletion of pages or whole paragraphs. One solution would be to strike out on the drawing reference signs that have been deleted in the description. Such corrections must be made in accordance with Art. 2(11) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022.

Where for any reason a figure is deleted then the applicant or proprietor ought to delete all reference signs relating solely to that figure appearing in the description and claims.

In the case of applications dealing with complex subjects and incorporating a large number of drawings, a reference key may be attached to the end of the description. This key may take whatever form is appropriate and contain all the reference signs together with the designation of the features that they indicate. This method could have the advantage of standardising the terminology used in the description.7.5.5 Consistent use of reference signs in drawings

The same features, when denoted by reference signs, must be denoted by the same signs throughout the application.

It would be very confusing if a single feature were allocated different reference signs in the various drawings. However, where several variants of an invention are described, each with reference to a particular figure, and where each variant contains features whose function is the same or basically the same, the features may, if this is indicated in the description, be identified by reference numbers made up of the number of the figure to which it relates followed by the number of the feature, which is the same for all variants, so that a single number is formed, e.g. the common feature "15" would be indicated by "115" in Fig. 1 while the corresponding feature would be indicated by "215" in Fig. 2. This system has the advantage that an individual feature and the figure on which it is to be considered can be indicated at the same time. It can also make complex cases involving many pages of drawings easier to read. Instead of the common reference sign being prefixed by the number of a figure, it may, when the individual variants are described with reference to particular groups of figures, be prefixed by the number of the particular variant to which it relates; this should be explained in the description.7.6 Variations in proportions

Elements of the same figure must be in proportion to each other unless a difference in proportion is indispensable for the clarity of the figure.

As a preferred alternative to a difference in proportion within one figure for clarity purposes, a supplementary figure may be added giving a larger-scale illustration of the element of the initial figure. In such cases it is recommended that the enlarged element shown in the second figure be surrounded by a finely drawn or "dot-dash" circle in the first figure pinpointing its location without obscuring the figure.8. Text matter on drawings

It should first be noted that Art. 1(2)(d) and Art. 1(2)(g) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 also applies to text matter on the drawings.

For indications of the type "section on AB", see A‑IX, 7.3.1.

The drawings must not contain text matter except when absolutely indispensable, and then only a single word or a few words. As flow sheets and diagrams are considered drawings (see A‑IX, 1.1), text must be kept to the absolute minimum indispensable for understanding the drawing.

Where text matter is deemed indispensable for understanding the drawing, only the barest minimum of words should be used, and a space free of all lines of drawings should be left around them for the translation.

Compared with other types of drawings, flow sheets comprising method steps may need more than just a bare minimum of words to be understood since the essential information may not be adequately conveyed by the graphical part of the drawing. In such cases, the requirement to keep the text to an absolute minimum may be relaxed somewhat to allow more than a few words, such as a short sentence, for each method step.

As regards the justification for text matter on drawings, see F‑II, 5.1.9. Conventional symbols

Known devices may be illustrated by symbols having a universally recognised conventional meaning, provided no further detail is essential for understanding the subject-matter of the invention. Other signs and symbols may be used on condition that they are not likely to be confused with existing conventional symbols, that they are readily identifiable, i.e. simple, and that they are clearly explained in the text of the description.

Different types of hatching may also have different conventional meanings as regards the nature of a material seen in cross-section.10. Amendments to drawings

Amendments are permitted to the drawings, as well as to the other documents. These amendments may be made at the request of the party concerned or of the EPO. The amendments may concern either clerical errors or more substantial changes.

Amendments to drawings are, in general, subject to the same rules as apply in respect of amendments to other application documents and therefore do not require further analysis here. See also A‑III, 16, A‑V, 2, B‑XI, 8, C‑III, 2, C‑IV, 5, Part H, in particular H‑II, 2 and H‑III, 2.

The general rule governing the admissibility of amendments, which the examiner must always bear in mind, is that they must not extend the content of the application as filed, i.e. they must not have the effect of introducing new material.

If drawings that depart substantially from the physical requirements laid down in the Implementing Regulations are filed to establish a particular date of filing or retain a priority date, the Receiving Section will permit them to be amended or replaced to provide drawings complying with the Implementing Regulations, provided that it is clear that the amendments do not introduce new material into the application. In view of this proviso, applicants should take care that any "informal" drawings filed clearly show all the features necessary to illustrate the invention.

11.1 Chemical and mathematical formulae

11.2 Tables11.1 Chemical and mathematical formulae

In exceptional cases, chemical or mathematical formulae may be written by hand or drawn if necessary, but it is recommended that appropriate aids such as stencils or transfers be used. For practical reasons, formulae may be grouped together on one or more sheets annexed to the description and paginated with it. It is recommended in such cases that each formula be designated by a reference sign and the description should contain references to these formulae whenever necessary.

Chemical or mathematical formulae must employ symbols in general use and must be drawn in such a way that they are completely unambiguous. Figures, letters and signs that are not typed must be legible and identical in form in the various formulae, irrespective of the document in which they appear.

Chemical or mathematical formulae appearing in the text of the application or patent must have symbols, the capital letters of which are at least 0.21 cm high. Where they appear on sheets of drawings, these symbols must be at least 0.32 cm high.

All mathematical symbols used in a formula appearing in a description, in an annex or on sheets of drawings must be explained in the description unless their significance is clear from the context. In any case, the mathematical symbols used may be collated in a list.11.2 Tables

11.2.1 Tables in the description

11.2.2 Tables in the claims11.2.1 Tables in the description

For the sake of convenience, the tables may also be grouped together on one or more sheets annexed to the description and paginated with it.

If two or more tables are necessary, each should be identified by a Roman number, independently of the pagination of the description or drawings or of the figure numbering, or by a capital letter, or by a title indicating its contents, or by some other means.

Each line or column in a table must begin with an entry explaining what it represents and, if necessary, the units used.

Both characters and tables alike must satisfy the requirements of Art. 2(7) and (4) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 regarding the maximum usable surface areas of sheets.11.2.2 Tables in the claims

The claims may include tables if their subject-matter indicates a need for them. In this case, the tables must be included in the text of the relevant claim; they may not be annexed to the claims nor may reference be made to tables contained in or annexed to the description. The claims may refer to other application documents only where this is absolutely necessary (see F‑IV, 4.17). The mere desire to avoid copying said documents does not constitute absolute necessity.Chapter X – Fees

Various fees have to be paid for a European patent application, to renew a European patent and to obtain legal remedies. Fees may also need to be paid by third parties, as is the case, for example, for issuing certified copies of documents or the certified extract from the European Patent Register (see OJ EPO 2019, A15). Fees may be validly paid by any person. The amounts of the fees, the ways in which they are to be paid and the date of payment are determined in the Rules relating to Fees (RFees). Guidance for the payment of fees, expenses and prices with information about:

– the current version of the Rules relating to Fees and the schedule of fees

– important implementing rules to the Rules relating to Fees

– the payment and refund of fees and expenses

– other notices concerning fees and prices and

– international applications, including Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase,

as well as the amounts of the principal fees for European and international applications and an extract from the Rules relating to Fees is published at regular intervals in the Official Journal. lnformation relating to fees and methods of payment, including the EPO bank account for payments in euro, can also be found on the EPO website (epo.org) under: Applying for a patent/Fees.

The EPC and its Implementing Regulations lay down the time limits for paying fees and the legal consequences of non-compliance with the time limits. The time limits for payment and the legal consequences of non-payment are dealt with in the chapters of the Guidelines covering the respective stages of the procedure. The methods of payment, the date on which payment is considered to be made, due dates, particulars concerning the purpose of payments and reimbursement of fees are all dealt with below.2. Methods of payment

Fees may be paid:

(i)by payment or transfer to a bank account held by the EPO

(ii)by debiting a deposit account opened in the records of the EPO in Munich (see A‑X, 4.2 and A-X, 4.3)

(iii)by credit card (see A‑X, 4.4)

(iv)by requesting reallocation of a refund (see A‑X, 10.4).

Art. 5 RFees3. Currencies

The fees due to the EPO must be paid in euro. A debit order must be in euro.

4.3 Automatic debiting procedure

4.4 Payment by credit card4.1 Payment or transfer to a bank account held by the European Patent Organisation

The date on which payment is deemed made is the date on which the amount payable actually enters the European Patent Organisation's bank account. The date on which payment is deemed made may therefore be the day following the payment or transfer or an even later date in the event of delays within the bank. However, payment may still be considered made in due time, despite being paid late, if the payment or transfer was effected before expiry of the time limit for payment in a contracting state and if evidence to this effect is provided (see A‑X, 6). For the steps required for the efficient processing of payments made by bank transfer, see the notice from the EPO dated 19 July 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A81.

The Arrangements for deposit accounts (ADA) and their annexes are updated on a regular basis, either in their entirety or in part, whenever a change or clarification of the scope of practice is required. A consolidated version of the ADA was last published as Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2022. The ADA can also be found on the EPO website (epo.org) under: Applying for a patent/Fees.

A distinction must be drawn, in connection with deposit accounts, between:

Art. 7(2) RFees

(i)payments to replenish deposit accounts and

Point 3 ADA

(ii)payments of fees in connection with proceedings under the EPC or the PCT.

Point 1 ADA4.2.2 Payments to replenish a deposit account

Payments to replenish a deposit account are to be made in euro to the EPO bank account. Payments in a different currency will only be accepted if freely convertible. However, the deposit account will always be credited in euro (the only currency in which these accounts are kept) after conversion at the current rate of exchange. Replenishments are credited to the deposit account on the date on which the payment actually enters the EPO bank account.

Point 3.2 ADA Point 3.3 ADA

Repayments of deposit account balances can only be remitted to the deposit account holder. For this purpose, the deposit account holder must send a signed request as an email attachment to the EPO at support@epo.org or complete the online contact form available on the EPO website and submit it together with with all bank details necessary for the transfer (point 5.2 ADA).

Point 4.2 ADA Point 5.2 ADA4.2.3 Debiting the deposit account

Debiting occurs on the basis of an electronic debit order which has been duly signed or authenticated by the account holder, or the authorised representative or a person authorised by the account holder using means accepted for the online service in question. The signature may take the form of a text string signature, a facsimile signature, an enhanced electronic signature or authentication with smart card if payment is made via Central Fee Payment. The debit order may be for individual fees for one or more applications, i.e. a single debit order for individual fees for one or more patent applications, i.e. a single or or, if given in Central Fee Payment, a batch debit order, - than one , or an automatic debit order for one or more patent applications. Batch debit orders are only possible in Central Fee Payment (see A‑X, 4.3).

Point 7.1.1 ADA

The debit order for European patent applications must be filed in an electronically processable format (XML) via:

– EPO Online Filing using EPO Forms 1001E, 1200E, 2300E or 1038E

– Online Filing 2.0 using EPO Forms 1001E, 1200E or 1038E

– Central Fee Payment.

See also the decision of the President of the EPO dated 19 July 2022 concerning the revision of the Arrangements for deposit accounts and their annexes, Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2022, and the notice from the EPO dated 19 July 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A81, the decision of the President of the EPO dated 24 April 2023 concerning the revision of the Arrangements for deposit accounts and their annexes in view of the entry into force of the Unitary Patent system, Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2023, 10, the notice from the EPO dated 24 April 2023, Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2023, 20, and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 13 June 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A58.

Point 7.1.2 ADA Point 7.1.3 ADA

Debit orders submitted in any other way, e.g. on paper, by fax, via the EPO web-form filing service or the EPO Contingency Upload Service or using a different format such as a PDF attachment, are invalid and thus will not be executed (for an exception, see A‑II, 1.5). This may result in the time limit for paying a fee being missed. In that case applicants may make use of any of the legal remedies available.

Point 7.1.3 ADA Point 10.3 ADA

If any of the accepted means of filing debit orders is unavailable at the EPO on the last day for paying a particular fee, the payment period will be extended until the next day on which all such means as are available for the type of application concerned can be accessed again. Payment periods are also extended in the event of a general unavailability of electronic communication services, or other like reasons within the meaning of Rule 134(5) (see the notice from the EPO dated 22 October 2020, OJ EPO 2020, A120).

When using the EPO's online filing services, "deposit account" must be selected as the payment method to pay any selected fees.

Rule 134(1) and (5)

Point 11 ADA

In general, debit orders will be processed immediately upon their receipt, provided there are sufficient funds in the deposit account and provided a deferred execution date (see next paragraph) has not been specified. Automatic debit orders are processed at the end of the day on the decisive payment date.

Point 7.2.1 ADA Point 4.4 AAD

A debit order may specify that payment is to be executed at a date later than the submission date. In that case, the payment date is deemed to be the execution date specified. Payment orders with a deferred execution date may be executed up to 40 days after the submission date.

A debit order must be carried out notwithstanding incorrect information given in it if the intention of the person giving the order is clear (see T 152/82). The EPO corrects a debit order on its own initiative, for example, if there is a discrepancy between the type of fee intended to be paid and the corresponding amount due on the date of receipt of the debit order (see also A‑X, 7.1.2). The party is informed of any such correction by means of a communication from the EPO providing a two-month period for objection in the event of disagreement by the party. In that case, the fee will be debited as indicated in the (erroneous) debit order or, if applicable, any corrective booking executed will be reverted. The principles outlined above, however, do not allow the correction of a debit order by adding any fee that is not indicated in it, even if, according to the status of proceedings, that fee is due on the date of receipt of the debit order.

Point 10.2 ADA

A debit order may be revoked in whole or in part by the person making the payment by sending a signed written notice to support@epo.org by email or by completing the online contact form available on the EPO website (epo.org) and submitting it together with the signed written notice. For a debit order revocation notice to be effective, it must be received by the EPO no later than on the date on which the debit order is received. A debit order with deferred payment date may be revoked in Central Fee Payment until one day before the intended execution date or at the latest on the intended execution date by signed written notice sent to the EPO as indicated above.

Point 13 ADA

Payments via deposit account effected in Central Fee Payment are validated, meaning that the debit order for a fee is automatically rejected if the fee falls within one of the following categories:

– renewal fees and fees for the transfer of rights made in respect of patent applications for which the loss of rights or the refusal has become final

– renewal fees for granted European patents

– renewal fees received before the earliest valid payment dates under Rule 51(1)

– double-payments for fees that can be paid only once in the proceedings before the EPO.

Point 9 ADA4.2.4 Date of receipt of the debit order; insufficient funds

Provided there are sufficient funds in the deposit account on the date the EPO receives the debit order or on the execution date, that date will be considered the date on which the payment is made.

This applies also where a debit order is filed together with an application filed under Art. 75(1)(b) with a competent national authority of a contracting state (see A‑II, 1.6). If the EPO does not receive the debit order until after expiry of the period allowed for paying fees due which can be paid on filing, that period is deemed observed if evidence is available or presented to the EPO to show that the debit order was filed with the competent authority of the contracting state at the same time as the application, provided that sufficient funds were available in the account at the time the period expired.

Point 7.2.1 ADA Point 7.4.1 ADA

If, on the date of receipt of the debit order or on the date specified as the execution date (point 10 ADA), the account does not contain sufficient funds to fully cover all the fees indicated for an application (shortfall), the fees are booked in ascending order of application number ("PCT" before "EP" before "UP") and fee code, according to point 7.3 ADA, as long as the funds allow. Once a debit order cannot be executed in full due to insufficient funds, no other debit order is booked until the account is duly replenished. The outstanding payment is considered to have been made on the date on which the deposit account is duly replenished. On the application of the safety provision in the case of late receipt of the replenishment payment at the EPO, see A‑X, 6.2.2.

Point 7.3 ADA Point 7.4.1 ADA Point 7.4.2 ADA Point 7.5 ADA4.3 Automatic debiting procedure

A deposit account may also be debited for one or more European patent applications on the basis of an automatic debit order, signed or authenticated by or on behalf of the account holder (automatic debiting procedure), in accordance with the Arrangements for the automatic debiting procedure (abbreviated to "AAD"). The AAD plus explanatory notes are published as Annexes A.1 and A.2 to the ADA in Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2022. The AAD can also be found on the EPO website (epo.org) under: Applying for a patent/Fees.

An automatic debit order may be filed on behalf of the applicant, the patent proprietor or the appointed representative and must be filed in an electronically processable format (XML) via the EPO Online Filing software or Online Filing 2.0 using EPO Forms 1001E, 1200E or 1038E, or via Central Fee Payment. An automatic debit order can be revoked only via Central Fee Payment and only for the proceedings as a whole.

An automatic debit order extends to all types of fees covered by the automatic debiting procedure and payable in respect of the proceedings specified in it. As the proceedings progress, each fee is automatically debited and treated as having been paid in due time, provided that the deposit account contains sufficient funds. The automatic debit order may not be restricted to specific types of fees.

Point 14 ADA Point 1 AAD Point 10 AAD

In the case of multiple payments from the same deposit account, the EPO processes automatic debit orders in ascending order of application number ("PCT" before "EP" before "UP") and fee code (unless otherwise indicated) at the end of the day on the decisive payment date. It is thus important for the deposit account to contain sufficient funds at the decisive payment date to cover all automatic debit orders due.

Point 4.4 AAD Point 4.5 AAD Point 5 AAD4.4 Payment by credit card

Payment by credit card has been available since 1 December 2017 (see OJ EPO 2017, A72). Payments by credit card must be made via Central Fee Payment, which is available on the EPO website (epo.org), using a credit card accepted by the EPO (American Express, Mastercard and Visa). They are deemed made on the date on which the transaction is approved (see OJ EPO 2017, A72). The EPO bears any transaction-related charges. The requirements and arrangements for payments by credit card are set out in detail in the notice from the EPO dated 16 February 2022 (see OJ EPO 2022, A18).

Art. 5 RFees, Art. 7 RFees5. Due date for fees

5.1 General

5.2 Due date for specific fees5.1 General

5.1.1 Due date

5.1.2 Amount of the fee5.1.1 Due date

In the EPC, the term "due date" has a special meaning, namely the first day on which payment of a fee may be validly effected, not the last day of a period for such payment (see A‑X, 6, "Payment in due time"). The due date for fees is generally laid down by provisions of the EPC or of the PCT. If no due date is specified, the fee is due on the date of receipt of the request for the service incurring the fee concerned.

A fee may not be validly paid before the due date. The only exceptions are:

(i)renewal fees (see A‑X, 5.2.4)

(ii)fees paid voluntarily in response to the communication under Rule 71(3) (where amendments are also filed in response to that communication, see C‑V, 4.2).

Payments that may not be validly made before the due date may be refunded by the EPO. If payment is made shortly before the due date, it is possible that the EPO will not return the payment. In this case, however, payment only takes effect on the due date. This does not apply to payments via deposit account of renewal fees made before the earliest valid payment dates under Rule 51(1), see A‑X, 5.2.4.

Art. 4(1) RFees Rule 51(1), 2nd sentence5.1.2 Amount of the fee

When the fees are generally increased, the date of payment is set as the relevant date for determining the amount of the fees (see Art. 2 of the Administrative Council decision of 5 June 1992, OJ EPO 1992, 344). As a rule, setting the date of payment as the relevant date makes it unnecessary to ascertain the actual due date for determining the amount of the fee. Fees cannot validly be paid before the due date (apart from the exceptions mentioned in A‑X, 5.1.1(i) and A‑X, 5.1.1 (ii)).5.2 Due date for specific fees

5.2.5 Claims fees

5.2.6 Fees for limitation/revocation, opposition, appeal, petition for review

5.2.7 Fees payable for procedural and other requests5.2.1 Filing fee and search fee

The filing and search fees are due on the day the European patent application is filed. They must be paid either within one month of that date (Rule 38(1), Rule 17(2), Rule 36(3)) or, for Euro-PCT applications, within 31 months of the filing date or, where applicable, of the earliest priority claimed (Rule 159(1)(c) and (e)). Where fees are paid before expiry of the 31-month period and early processing is not explicitly requested (see E‑IX, 2.8), they will be retained by the EPO on the assumption that the applicant indeed wishes to pursue the European-phase processing of the application on expiry of the 31-month period (see A‑III, 13.1). For the additional fees payable as part of the filing fee, see A‑III, 13.2 and A‑IV, 1.4.1.1.5.2.2 Examination fee and designation fee

The examination fee is due when the request for examination is filed. Since the latter is contained in the request for grant form (EPO Form 1001), the examination fee may be paid straight away on the European patent application's filing date if the application is filed with said prescribed EPO Form 1001. It may be paid up to expiry of the period laid down in Rule 70(1), namely within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report.

The designation fee falls due upon publication of the mention of the European search report. It may be paid within six months of the mentioned date of publication (Rules 39(1), 17(3) and 36(4)). Where paid before the due date, e.g. upon filing of the application, the designation fee will however be retained by the EPO. These payments will only be considered valid from the due date, provided that the amount paid corresponds to the amount payable on the due date of payment (see A‑X, 5.1.2).

For Euro-PCT applications, see E‑IX, 2.1.4 and E‑IX, 2.8.5.2.3 Fee for grant and publishing

The fee for grant and publishing falls due on notification of the communication under Rule 71(3) requesting that this fee be paid. Under Rule 71(4), the same applies for claims fees added during the procedure to those that were already paid under Rule 45(1) and Rule 45(2) or Rule 162(1) and Rule 162(2) (see A‑X, 7.3.2).

Rule 71(1) Rule 71(4)5.2.4 Renewal fees

Renewal fees for a European patent application in respect of the coming year are due on the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the European patent application's filing date.

According to Rule 51(1) as amended with effect from 1 April 2018 (OJ EPO 2018, A2), the renewal fee in respect of the third year may be paid up to six months before it falls due. All other renewal fees may not be validly paid more than three months before they fall due.

Example A: 15.11.2016 Filing date 31.05.2018 Earliest date for valid payment of third-year renewal fee under Rule 51(1) 30.11.2018 Due date for third-year renewal fee under Rule 51(1) 31.08.2019 Earliest date for valid payment of fourth-year renewal fee under Rule 51(1) 30.11.2019 Due date for fourth-year renewal fee under Rule 51(1) Example B: 15.07.2016 Priority date 14.07.2017 Filing date 31.01.2019 Earliest date for valid payment of third-year renewal fee under Rule 51(1) 15.02.2019 Expiry of 31-month period for the performance of all acts required under Rule 159(1) 31.07.2019 Due date for third-year renewal fee under Rule 51(1) 30.04.2020 Earliest date for valid payment of fourth-year renewal fee under Rule 51(1) 31.07.2020 Due date for fourth year renewal fee under Rule 51(1)

Renewal fee payments made before the permissible prepayment periods are not valid. If a debit order for a renewal fee is received via Central Fee Payment before the earliest valid payment dates under Rule 51(1), it will be rejected at source by the validation functionality (see A‑X, 4.2.3). If a payment is made too early either by filing a valid debit order via OLF and Online Filing 2.0 or by using any other payment method (i.e. bank transfer or credit card), the renewal fee will be refunded by the EPO according to the procedures laid down in A‑X, 10.

Rule 51(1)

If the renewal fee has not been validly paid on or before the due date, it may still be validly paid within six months of the said date, provided that the additional fee is paid within this period. The additional fee can be paid until the last day of the sixth month following the month containing the anniversary of the date of filing (see J 4/91, reasons 2.7). This six-month period begins on the last day of the month referred to in Rule 51(1), first sentence, even if the circumstances described in Rule 134(1), (2) and (5) apply. Rule 134 is applicable to the calculation of the expiry of the six-month time limit for payment of the additional fee (see J 4/91, reasons 3.2). Whilst a notice draws the applicant's attention to the possibility under Rule 51(2) and Art. 2(1), item 5, RFees, the omission of such notification may not be invoked (see J 12/84 and J 1/89). For renewal fees for European divisional applications, see A‑IV, 1.4.3.

For Euro-PCT applications, if the renewal fee in respect of the third year would have fallen due earlier under Rule 51(1), it does not fall due until expiry of the 31st month, i.e. on the due date is deferred to the last day of the 31-month period under Rule 159(1). This deferred due date, and hence the expiry of another period (the 31-month period), forms the basis for calculating the additional period for payment of the renewal fee with an additional fee (see J 1/89, the principles of which apply). For example:

20.04.2016 (Wed) Priority date 17.10.2016 (Mon) Filing date 31.10.2018 (Wed) Due date for third-year renewal fee under Rule 51(1) 20.11.2018 (Tue) Expiry of 31-month period under Rule 159(1) = deferred due date for third-year renewal fee 20.05.2019 (Mon) Last day for payment of the renewal fee (plus additional fee) since the six-month period under Rule 51(2) expires that day

If the applicant requests entry into the regional phase before the expiry of the 31-month period (see Art. 23(2) PCT and Art. 40(2) PCT), in order for the request to become effective the renewal fee in respect of the third year has to be paid if the fee has fallen due earlier under Rule 51(1). If the renewal fee is not paid on the date early processing is requested, the request for early processing will be effective only from the date on which the renewal fee is paid (and all further requirements necessary on the latter date have been complied with) (see E‑IX, 2.8).

Rule 51(2) Rule 134

The obligation to pay renewal fees terminates with the payment of the renewal fee due in respect of the (patent) year in which the mention of the grant of the European patent is published, see Art. 86(2). "Patent years" are calculated as from the application's filing date. The first patent year (Art. 86(1), Art. 141(1)) starts on the filing date and ends on the same date of the following year. For the second and subsequent years, the patent year starts one day after the anniversary of the filing date and ends on the same day as the filing date of the following year.

Example of due date and time limits for payment:

15.12.2016 (Thu) Priority date 02.07.2017 (Sun) Filing date 31.01.2019 (Thu) First day for validly paying third-year renewal fee 31.07.2019 (Wed) Due date for third-year renewal fee under Rule 51(1) 31.01.2020 (Fri) Last day for validly paying renewal fee plus additional fee ( Rule 51(2) ); see J 4/91 , reasons 2.7 30.04.2020 (Thu) First day for validly paying fourth-year renewal fee 31.07.2020 (Fri) Due date for fourth-year renewal fee = last renewal fee to be paid to the EPO and last day for payment of this renewal fee without additional fee 04.11.2020 (Wed) Mention of grant of the European patent in the European Patent Bulletin

Example 1 of last renewal fee payable to the EPO:

21.01.2017 (Sat) Filing date 22.01.2019 (Tue) Start of third patent year 31.01.2019 (Thu) Due date for third-year renewal fee (to be paid to the EPO) 31.10.2019 (Thu) First day for validly paying fourth-year renewal fee 15.01.2020 (Wed) Mention of grant of the European patent in the European Patent Bulletin 22.01.2020 (Wed) Start of fourth patent year 31.01.2020 (Fri) Due date for fourth-year renewal fee (no longer to be paid to the EPO; if already paid, to be refunded, see A‑X, 10.1.1 )

This means that for the last renewal fee payable to the EPO, it is not the due date but the beginning of the respective patent year that is decisive. If the mention of the grant of the European patent is published on the anniversary of the filing date, the renewal fee in respect of the next patent year, which has not yet begun, is no longer payable to the EPO but to the national authorities.

Example 2 of last renewal fee payable to the EPO:

22.05.2017 (Mon) Filing date 23.05.2019 (Thu) Start of third patent year 31.05.2019 (Fri) Due date for third-year renewal fee (to be paid to the EPO) 12.05.2022 (Thu) Date of dispatch of communication under Rule 71(3) 20.05.2022 (Fri) Approval of the text for grant and translation of the claims submitted, fee for grant and publication and all claims paid 23.05.2022 (Mon) Start of sixth patent year 31.05.2022 (Tue) Due date for sixth-year renewal fee, payable to EPO ( Rule 71a(4) ) 30.11.2022 (Wed) Payment of the sixth renewal fee with additional fee ( Rule 51(2) ) 04.01.2023 (Wed) Mention of grant of the European patent in the European Patent Bulletin 31.05.2023 (Wed) Due date for seventh-year renewal fee (no longer to be paid to the EPO)

This means that, if the renewal fee in respect of the next patent year falls due after notification of the communication under Rule 71(3) and before the next possible date for publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent, the renewal fee is payable to the EPO (Rule 71a(4)). In that case, the mention of the grant will not be published until the renewal fee has been paid. If the renewal fee or any additional fee (Rule 51(2)) is not paid in time the application is deemed withdrawn.

Art. 86(1) and Art. 141(1)

Special provisions apply with regard to the due date for renewal fees in respect of cases where there is a successful request for re-establishment of rights under Art. 122 or a successful petition for review of a decision of the board of appeal under Art. 112a.

Rule 51(4) and (5)5.2.5 Claims fees

Claims fees are due upon filing the first set of claims, which may be the filing date or may occur later (see A‑III, 9 and A-III, 15).5.2.6 Fees for limitation/revocation, opposition, appeal, petition for review

All of these fees are due on the date that the document in question is filed (request for limitation, request for revocation, notice of opposition, notice of appeal and petition for review).5.2.7 Fees payable for procedural and other requests

The fees payable for procedural requests are due as provided for in the Implementing Regulations. These requests become effective on payment of the prescribed fee, which thus falls due on the request's filing date. This is the case, for example, for the fee for further processing (Art. 121, Rule 135(1), see also E‑VIII, 2) and the fee for re-establishment of rights (Art. 122, Rule 136(1), see also E‑VIII, 3). Similarly, the fees payable for other requests, such as the fee for the registration of transfers (Rule 22(2)) and the administrative fees laid down by the EPO President in accordance with Art. 3 RFees, for instance, for issuing a priority document (Rule 54) or a certificate for a European patent (Rule 74), fall due on the request's filing date.6. Payment in due time

6.1 Basic principle

6.2 Late payment of fees – period for payment considered observed6.1 Basic principle

A fee is considered to have been paid in due time if the date of payment (see A‑X, 4) fell on or before the last day of the relevant time limit – or the time limit extended under Rule 134.6.2 Late payment of fees – period for payment considered observed

6.2.1 Fees paid by bank transfer – application of Art. 7(3) and (4) RFees

6.2.2 Safety provision for late replenishment of deposit accounts

6.2.3 Debit orders filed with a competent national authority

6.2.4 Amount of fee payable

6.2.5 Noting of loss of rights6.2.1 Fees paid by bank transfer – application of Art. 7(3) and Art. 7(4) RFees

If a fee paid by bank transfer enters the EPO's bank account after the period in which it should have been made, the period for payment of that fee is considered observed if the payer provides evidence to the EPO that they fulfilled one of the following conditions in an EPC contracting state within the period for payment of that fee:

(i)payment of the fee was effected through a banking establishment

(ii)an order was duly given to a banking establishment to transfer the amount of the payment.

The EPO may ask the person who made the payment to produce evidence, within a period to be specified by it, as to the date on which one of the conditions mentioned above was fulfilled in order for the period for payment of the fee to be considered observed.

Where the period for payment is considered observed in application of Art. 7(3) RFees and Art. 7(4) RFees, any further processing fee paid will be refunded (see A‑X, 6.2.5).

Art. 7(3) RFees and Art. 7(4) RFees6.2.2 Safety provision for late replenishment of deposit accounts

Where a payment to replenish the deposit account is considered to have been made after expiry of a period in which it should have been made (see A‑X, 4.2.4), the EPO will consider the period as having been observed if evidence is provided that an adequate replenishment of the deposit account was authorised:

(i)at least one day before expiry of the period for paying the fee if using the SEPA Credit Transfer scheme

(ii)at the latest on the last day of the period for paying the fee if using the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme

(iii)at least three days before expiry of the period for paying the fee if any other type of order was given to a banking establishment within an EPC contracting state.

Where the requirements under point 7.5.1 ADA are fulfilled, any further processing fee paid will be refunded (see A‑X, 6.2.5).

Point 7.4.1 ADA Point 7.5.1 ADA6.2.3 Debit orders filed with a competent national authority

For debit orders accompanying applications filed with a competent national authority, see A‑X, 4.2.4 and A‑II, 1.5.6.2.4 Amount of fee payable

As noted in A‑X, 5.1.2, the amount of fee payable is always that applying on the date of payment (see also the transitional provisions in the Administrative Council decisions revising fees). Art. 7(3) RFees and Art. 7(4) RFees protects the applicant in the event of late payment from the legal consequences of expiry of the payment period but not from the obligation to make up any differences resulting from an increase in the amount of fee in the meantime. For debit orders accompanying applications filed with a competent national office (Art. 75(1)(b)), see point 12.3 of the ADA (Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2022).6.2.5 Noting of loss of rights

If applicants who have been sent a communication under Rule 112(1) noting non-compliance with a payment time limit claim that the payment was made in due time under Art. 7(1) RFees, Art. 7(3) RFees and Art. 7(4) RFees or in accordance with the safety provision for replenishment of deposit accounts, they must apply for a decision under Rule 112(2) and submit the requisite evidence. As an auxiliary request, applicants are advised to request further processing.

Rule 1127. Purpose of payment

7.1 General

7.2 Indication of the purpose of the payment in the case of designation fees

7.3 Indication of the purpose of payment in the case of claims fees7.1 General

7.1.1 Conditions for valid payment

7.1.2 Purpose of payment7.1.1 Conditions for valid payment

There are two conditions for a fee payment to be valid:

(i)it must relate to pending proceedings

(ii)it must be made in due time, i.e. the date of payment (see A‑X, 4) must be on or after the due date (see A‑X, 5.1.1). In addition, for a time limit for payment to be deemed observed, the full amount of the fee must have been paid in due time.

An essential condition for a valid payment to the EPO in the case of payment or transfer to the bank account held by the European Patent Organisation is that the amount enters that account. The payment is valid in respect of the amount entering the account. If an insufficient amount has been paid by mistake, it is not possible to rectify the error by having the shortfall paid subsequently deemed paid on the original date of payment. The same applies to payments made via credit card. Payment is a matter of fact whereby a certain amount is transferred to and put at the disposal of the EPO. It is not, therefore, a document filed with the EPO or a procedural declaration that may be corrected under Rule 139. However, the EPO may, where it is considered justified, overlook any small amounts lacking without prejudice to the rights of the person making the payment (Art. 8 RFees).

In the case of payment via deposit account, the essential condition, in addition to those specified under points (i)-(ii) above, is that the debit order clearly specifies the purpose of payment by indicating the fee intended to be paid, thus authorising the EPO to debit the fee for this particular purpose. Furthermore, the EPO can only debit the full amount of the fee if there are sufficient funds in the deposit account. In respect of underpayments due to incorrect information given in a debit order, see A‑X, 4.2.3. See also A‑X, 7.1.2 concerning corrections of the purpose of payment.

Art. 8 RFees7.1.2 Purpose of payment

A distinction must be drawn between these conditions for valid payment (see A‑X, 7.1.1) and the indication of the purpose of the payment. Indication of the purpose of the payment serves to identify the proceedings for which the fee is intended (e.g. for fee payments, the application number) and the specific type of fee. If the purpose of the payment cannot immediately be established, the person making the payment will be requested to communicate the purpose in writing within a specified period. If they comply with this request in due time, the payment and the original payment date remain valid. This is also the case when the clarification involves reassigning the payment to another application. Otherwise the payment will be considered not made. The boards of appeal have decided that if the purpose of the payment has evidently been given incorrectly, this deficiency is not prejudicial if the intended purpose can be established without difficulty from the remaining information. The inadvertent use of a fee by the EPO for a different purpose from that evidently intended by the person making the payment has no effect on the purpose intended by that person (see J 16/84). Similarly, a debit order must be carried out notwithstanding incorrect information given in it if the intention of the person giving the order is clear. Instructions to carry out the order must be given by the EPO department qualified to recognise what is clearly intended (see T 152/82).

In the case of changes to the purpose of payment not arising from Art. 6(2) RFees, the date of payment is the date of receipt of the request for the change.

Art. 6 RFees7.2 Indication of the purpose of the payment in the case of designation fees

The following applies only to applications filed before 1 April 2009.

The designation fees are deemed paid for all contracting states upon payment of seven times the amount of one designation fee. Such payments simply need to be marked "designation fees" in order for the purpose of the payment to be established. If fewer than seven designation fees are paid and the payment agrees with the declaration in the appropriate section of the request for grant form (EPO Form 1001), payment should once again simply be marked "designation fees". However, if the payment differs from the intended payment as stated on the request form, the contracting states for which the payment is now intended should be indicated with the payment.

If there is no such indication and the amount paid is insufficient to cover all the contracting states mentioned in the appropriate section of the request form, the procedure under A‑III, 11.3.7 applies.

If an automatic debit order has been given, applicants must inform the EPO prior to expiry of the basic period under Rule 39(1) if they wish to pay designation fees for contracting states other than those indicated on the request form. If not, an amount equal to seven times the amount of one designation fee or the designation fees for the contracting states indicated on the request form is debited.

The same applies for Euro-PCT applications that entered the European phase before 1 April 2009.

Art. 2(2), item 3, RFees Art. 6(1) RFees7.3 Indication of the purpose of payment in the case of claims fees

7.3.1 Claims fees payable on filing the European patent application

7.3.2 Claims fees payable before the grant of the European patent7.3.1 Claims fees payable on filing the European patent application

If the applicant pays the claims fees for all the claims incurring fees, the indication "claims fees" suffices to identify the purpose of the payment. If the amount paid is insufficient to cover all the claims fees, the procedure under A‑III, 9 applies.

Rule 45(1)7.3.2 Claims fees payable before the grant of the European patent

In the communication under Rule 71(3), the applicant may be requested to pay claims fees due before the European patent is granted. If the applicant fails to pay the fee for all the claims in due time, the application is deemed withdrawn (Rule 71(7)).

Rule 71(4)8. No deferred payment of fees, no legal aid, no discretion

The EPC makes no provision for deferring payment of fees (see J 2/78, reasons 3) or for granting legal aid. An indigent party can still apply for legal aid from the competent national authority. However, the time limit for payment is not extended in such a case; a party claiming national legal aid must make the corresponding arrangements as early as possible so that they are in a position to pay the fee in due time. The EPO has no discretion in waiving or refunding, without any legal basis, fees that have become due (see J 20/87).9. Reduction of fees

9.1 General

9.2 Reduction under the language arrangements

9.3 Special reductions9.1 General

Where a fee reduction applies, is reduced – in contrast to cases of fee refunds – the reduced rate may be paid instead of the full fee. The factual conditions for a reduction of the fee must be met on or before the day the payment is made period for payment expires.9.2 Reduction under the language arrangements

9.2.1 Conditions

9.2.2 Reduction of the filing fee

9.2.3 Reduction of the examination fee9.2.1 Conditions

European patent applications can be filed in any language. If filed in a language other than an official EPO language, a translation must be furnished. Consequently, the languages that can be used for filing European patent applications fall into three categories:

(a)official EPO languages

(b)official languages of contracting states other than English, French or German, such as Dutch, Italian or Spanish ("admissible non‑EPO languages")

(c)all other languages, such as Chinese, Japanese or Korean.

Art. 14(2)

Furthermore, documents that have to be filed within a time limit may also be filed in an admissible non‑EPO language if the applicant's residence or principal place of business is within the territory of a contracting state having the language in question as an official language or if the applicant is a national of such a contracting state (see A‑VII, 1.1 and A-VII, 1.2).

Art. 14(4)

In the case of European patent applications filed on or after 1 April 2014 and international applications entering the European phase on or after that date, a 30% reduction of the filing and/or examination fee for certain categories of applicants is provided for. For international applications entering the European phase on or after 1 April 2014, a 30% reduction of the examination fee is provided for (see the notice from the EPO dated 10 January 2014, OJ EPO 2014, A23). In this regard, it is necessary to file the documents making up the application "as filed" and/or the request for examination in an admissible non‑EPO language, and to file the translation not earlier than simultaneously (see G 6/91).

Rule 6(3) Art. 14(1) RFees

The categories of applicants eligible for the fee reductions are:

– small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)

– natural persons

– non-profit organisations, universities and public research organisations

whose residence or principal place of business is in an EPC contracting state with an official language other than English, French or German, and nationals of such states who are resident abroad.

Rule 6(4)

The definition of SMEs is that contained in European Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 as published in the Official Journal of the European Union. Under the recommendation, an enterprise is considered to be any entity engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form. The category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises is made up of enterprises employing fewer than 250 persons, having an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million and for which no more than 25% of the capital is held directly or indirectly by another company that is not an SME.

The eligibility of the further entities listed in Rule 6(4) is subject to the following definitions:

(i)"Non-profit organisations" are organisations not allowed by their legal form or statutes, under the relevant law, to be a source of income, profit or other financial gain to their owners, or – if allowed to make a profit – there is a legal or statutory obligation to reinvest the profits made in the interest of the organisation.

(ii)"Universities" are to be understood as "classical" universities, meaning institutions of higher education and research, under the relevant law. However, comparable entities, such as secondary or higher education establishments, will be considered to be universities.

(iii)"Public research organisations" are entities such as universities or research institutes that are organised under public law and, irrespective of how they are financed, have the primary goal of conducting fundamental research, industrial research or experimental development and of disseminating the results by way of teaching, publication or technology transfer. All profits must be reinvested in carrying out these activities, in disseminating the results or in teaching.

Rule 6(5)

If there are multiple applicants, each one must be an entity or a natural person within the meaning of Rule 6(4) for the fee reduction to apply; it is however sufficient for only one of them to be entitled to use an admissible non‑EPO language (Art. 14(4), Rule 6(3)).

Rule 6(7)

Applicants wishing to benefit from the reduction in the filing or examination fee under Art. 14(1) RFees must expressly declare that they are an entity or natural person covered by Rule 6(4).

Changes in the status of an entity under Rule 6(4) occurring after filing the declaration will not have a retroactive effect on fee reductions that were justified when granted.

The EPO will conduct checks to ensure compliance with the eligibility criteria laid down in Rule 6(3) to Rule 6(7). If the checks give rise to reasonable doubt in the course of the grant proceedings as to the veracity of the declaration given by the applicant, the EPO may request appropriate evidence.

Should it become apparent that an incorrect declaration has been filed, the fee would not be validly paid since it was reduced unjustifiably and the application may be deemed withdrawn under Art. 78(2) and/or Art. 94(2). The same applies if no declaration has been filed. Where applicable, the loss of rights arising from an incorrect or missing declaration may be remedied by filing a request for further processing under Art. 121 and Rule 135 – subject to making good any underpayment and paying the fee for further processing (see E‑VIII, 2) – or by requesting a decision under Rule 112(2) (see E‑VIII, 1.9.3).

In respect of European patent applications, oppositions, appeals, petitions for review or requests for limitation or revocation filed before 1 April 2014 and international applications having entered the European phase before that date, the fee reduction in force until then was applied.

Rule 6(6)9.2.2 Reduction of the filing fee

On filing a European patent application, the presence of a description is necessary for the accordance of a filing date (Rule 40(1)(c)). ; claims are no longer required for this. According to J 4/88, only the The description, therefore, and claims needs needed to be in an admissible non‑EPO language to qualify for the fee reduction (not the request for grant, for example; see J 4/88). However, since claims are no longer required for a filing date, the essential element is now the description.

Consequently, the filing fee is reduced if the European patent application (i.e. at least the description) is filed in an admissible non‑EPO language and the applicant satisfies the eligibility criteria mentioned in A‑X, 9.2.1.

Where the application is filed by reference to a previously filed application (see A‑II, 4.1.3.1), and the previously filed application referred to is in an admissible non‑EPO language, and the applicant satisfies the eligibility criteria mentioned in A‑X, 9.2.1, then the applicant is also entitled to the reduction in the filing fee. For the purposes of the reduction, it does not matter whether the applicant requested that the claims of the previously filed application take the place of the claims in the application as filed (see above).

The reduction of the filing fee is also applicable to divisional applications if the parent application was filed in an admissible non‑EPO language (see A‑IV, 1.3.3 and A‑X, 9.2.1) and the divisional application is filed in the same admissible non‑EPO language as the earlier application (Rule 36(2) and Rule 6(3)), provided that the other requirements for the reduction are met (see above) and a translation is filed in time (see A‑X, 9.2.1).

Since the additional fees that are payable if the application either comprises more than 35 pages or is a second- or further generation divisional application form part of the filing fee, the reduction applies also to them.9.2.3 Reduction of the examination fee

Applicants eligible for the fee reduction will be allowed a reduction in the examination fee if the request for examination is filed in an admissible non‑EPO language. EPO Forms 1001 (Request for grant of a European patent) and Form 1200 (Entry into the European phase) contain drop-down menus/pre-printed boxes where the request for examination in an admissible non‑EPO language and the declaration under Rule 6(6) can be selected/entered. In these cases, the filing of a translation of the request is not necessary, since the written request for examination in the three EPO official languages is preselected in the same forms. Wordings for the request for examination in the admissible non‑EPO languages are listed on the EPO website. Where the request for examination in an admissible non‑EPO language is filed subsequent to EPO Form 1001 or EPO Form 1200, a translation of the request for examination in the procedural languages must be refiled (see G 6/91). Subsequent documents related to examination proceedings need not be filed in the admissible non‑EPO language.

If the conditions for the reduction of the examination fee where the EPO has drawn up the international preliminary examination report are also fulfilled, see A‑X, 9.3.2.

Art. 14(4) Rule 69.3 Special reductions

9.3.1 Reduction of the search fee for a supplementary European search

9.3.2 Reduction of the examination fee where the international preliminary examination report is drawn up by the EPO9.3.1 Reduction of the search fee for a supplementary European search

The search fee for a supplementary European search report is reduced by a fixed amount for PCT applications for which the patent office of Austria, Finland, Spain, Sweden or Türkiye, the Nordic Patent Institute or the Visegrad Patent Institute was the International Searching Authority or where one of these offices prepared the supplementary international search report (see the Administrative Council decisions of 27 October 2011, OJ EPO 2011, 616; 25 October 2012, OJ EPO 2012, 584; 16 December 2015, OJ EPO 2016, A2; 28 June 2017, OJ EPO 2017, A57; 12 December 2019, OJ EPO 2020, A3; and 15 December 2021, OJ EPO 2022, A2; and 14 December 2022, OJ EPO 2023, A25).

Where the requirements for fee reduction are fulfilled, the fee reduction is granted only once, i.e. for the supplementary search fee paid under Rule 159(1)(e). The reduction applies independently of whether the first invention in the claims was searched by the ISA in the international phase. The reduction does not apply to any further search fee (to be) paid under Rule 164(1).

No reduction of the supplementary search fee applies for PCT applications for which an International Searching Authority other than the ones mentioned above was selected. For the latest overview of the amounts payable, see the notice from the EPO dated 21 March 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A29 6 March 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A28.

Art. 153(7)9.3.2 Reduction of the examination fee where the international preliminary examination report is drawn up by the EPO

Where the EPO has drawn up the international preliminary examination report in respect of an international application, the examination fee is reduced by 75% in proceedings before the EPO as elected Office. Accordingly, the reduction applies to the Euro-PCT application entering the European phase. The reduction of the examination fee does not apply to divisional applications for whose parent application the EPO has drawn up the international preliminary examination report.

If the conditions for a reduction under the language arrangements (see A‑X, 9.2.3) are also fulfilled, the examination fee is first reduced by 75%, then by a further 30%, i.e. the total reduction is 82.5%, or the amount payable is 17.5% of the full fee.

Art. 14(2) RFees10. Refund of fees

10.1 General remarks

10.2 Special refunds

10.3 Method of refund

10.4 Reallocation instead of refund10.1 General remarks

A fee that has been validly paid (see A‑X, 7.1.1) is not refunded. For instance, a validly paid further processing fee is not refunded if the request for further processing is rejected due to non-completion of the omitted act, which is another requirement of Rule 135(1) (see E‑VIII, 2). As an exception to this general principle, a validly paid fee is refunded if there are special provisions for the refund in either the EPC or the Rules relating to Fees (see A‑X, 2).

By contrast, any fee that has not been validly paid is to be refunded (see A‑X, 10.1.1 to A‑X, 10.1.3 below).

10.1.1 Fee payments lacking a legal basis

10.1.2 Late payments

10.1.3 Insignificant amounts10.1.1 Fee payments lacking a legal basis

If a payment does not relate to a pending European patent application (e.g. it relates to a patent application already deemed withdrawn) or to pending proceedings, there is no legal basis for the payment. In these cases, the amount paid must be refunded.

If the payment is made before or on the due date and if, no later than that date, the legal basis ceases to exist (e.g. because the patent application is deemed withdrawn or is withdrawn), the amount paid is to be refunded. For the designation fee and renewal fees ,see A‑X, 5.2.2 and 5.2.4 respectively. Fees paid after the due date and before expiry of the time limit for payment are refunded only if there is a particular reason for a refund (see A‑X, 10.2).10.1.2 Late payments

The payment of a fee after expiry of the applicable time limit is not valid and must be refunded unless a valid request for further processing has been filed. Examples: filing fee, search fee, designation fee or examination fee paid as laid down under the provisions relating to further processing (Art. 121 and Rule 135), without the further processing fee required by Rule 135(1) and Art. 2(1), item 12, RFees (see E‑VIII, 2).10.1.3 Insignificant amounts

Where the sum paid is larger than the fee, the excess will not be refunded if the amount is insignificant and the party concerned has not expressly requested a refund. It has been decided that any amount up to EUR 16 17 constitutes an insignificant amount (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 February 2020, OJ EPO 2020, A17 7 March 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A27).

Art. 12 RFees10.2 Special refunds

10.2.1 Refund of the search fee

10.2.2 Refund of the further search fee

10.2.3 Refund of the examination fee

10.2.4 Refund under Rule 37(2)

10.2.5 Refund of the fee for grant and publishing

10.2.6 Refund of the appeal fee10.2.1 Refund of the search fee

The search fee for a European or supplementary European search is refunded in the cases provided for in Art. 9 RFees and in the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 January 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A8 17 January 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A4, which applies to European patent applications in respect of which the European or supplementary European search is completed on or after 1 April 2022 1 April 2023. Details on criteria for refund of search fees are given in the notice from the EPO dated 9 January 2009, OJ EPO 2009, 99, according to which the search division will determine the level of refund to be applied. In the event of disagreement, the applicant may request an appealable decision (Art. 106(2)), which is issued by the Receiving Section where the examining division has not yet assumed responsibility for the application (Rule 10) (see B‑XI, 2).

For the purposes of Art. 9(1) RFees, the date of the start of the search is indicated by means of EPO Form 1704 in the public part of the dossier and is thus open to file inspection in the European Patent Register after the patent application's publication (see also B‑IV, 1). Before publication, the EPO will provide the applicant with the relevant information upon request, or this information can be accessed electronically via the MyEPO Portfolio and My Files or MyEPO Portfolio service services.

Art. 9 RFees Rule 1010.2.2 Refund of the further search fee

If an applicant has paid a further search fee following a communication from the search division under Rule 64(2) but the examining division finds, on request, that the communication was not justified, the further search fee will be refunded. The same principle applies if the applicant has paid a search fee on the basis of an invitation by the examining division under Rule 164(2) (see C‑III, 3.1). In such cases, the examining division will, on request, review the justification for charging the search fee in its invitation under Rule 164(2) (see C‑III, 3.4).

Rule 64(2), Rule 164(5)10.2.3 Refund of the examination fee

The examination fee will be refunded in the situations described in Art. 11 RFees (see A‑VI, 2.2, third paragraph, and A‑VI, 2.5).

Art. 11 RFees10.2.4 Refund under Rule 37(2)

If a European patent application filed with a competent national authority is deemed withdrawn under Art. 77(3), all fees, in particular the filing, search and designation fees and any claims fees paid, will be refunded.

Rule 37(2)10.2.5 Refund of the fee for grant and publishing

If the application is refused, withdrawn prior to notification of the decision on the grant of a European patent or, at that time, deemed withdrawn, the fee for grant and publishing will be refunded. The date of the decision's notification is determined as indicated in E‑II, 2. Note that this date is later than the date on which the decision is handed over to the EPO internal postal service (i.e. decision G 12/91 does not apply in this case).

This may happen, for example, where the applicant pays the fee for grant and publishing within the Rule 71(3) period but does not pay the claims fees due and/or neglects to file the translations of the claims leading to deemed withdrawal of the application under Rule 71(7) (see C‑V, 3).

Where the application is refused, the refund will be effected only after the period for filing an appeal has expired without an appeal being filed (see E‑XII, 6). Where the application is deemed withdrawn, the refund will be effected only after the period for requesting further processing has expired without further processing being requested by the applicant (see E‑VIII, 2).

Rule 71a(6)10.2.6 Refund of the appeal fee

The appeal fee may be refunded in full or in part in some specific situations provided for in Rule 103. However, the department of first instance is only competent to decide on and order a full refund of the appeal fee in the case of an interlocutory revision if it considers the reimbursement equitable by reason of a substantial procedural violation (Rule 103(1)(a)).

In all other situations, reimbursement of the appeal fee, in part or in full, is decided on by the board of appeal.

Rule 10310.3 Method of refund

Refunds are made either to a deposit account held with the EPO or by transfer to a bank account (see the notice from the EPO dated 27 February 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A26). Refunds are not made to a credit card account (see the notice from the EPO dated 16 February 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A18).

10.3.1 Refunds to a deposit account

10.3.2 Refunds to a bank account10.3.1 Refunds to a deposit account

Fees are refunded to any deposit account that the applicant, proprietor or opponent/appellant (if applicant or proprietor) has indicated in its refund instructions. In most cases this will be the deposit account of the party to the proceedings itself, but it may also be a third party's deposit account. The EPO notifies the party to the proceedings about the intended refund and the deposit account to which the amount will be credited in a separate communication.

Refund instructions, i.e. to which deposit account refunds are to be made, are to be filed in an electronically processable format (XML) via EPO Online Filing or Online Filing 2.0, using EPO Form 1001E, 1200E or 1038E, preferably as early as possible in the proceedings before the EPO. Refund instructions submitted in any other way, e.g. on paper, by fax, via the EPO web-form filing service or the EPO Contingency Upload Service, are invalid and will not be processed. Refund instructions can be updated at any time using EPO Form 1038E.

For international applications filed with the EPO as receiving Office or for which the EPO acted as an International Authority under the PCT, new refund instructions are to be filed when entering the European phase using EPO Form 1200E.

In the case of a request for a change of representative or a transfer of rights, new refund instructions, if applicable, should be submitted as soon as possible using EPO Form 1038E, preferably together with the request. The updated refund instructions will apply only once the EPO has confirmed the change's recording. If no new refund instructions are present, a deposit account recorded for an applicant or representative who has withdrawn from the proceedings will be deleted by the EPO on its own initiative. The same applies to the deposit account held by a third party indicated in the refund instructions of the former applicant or representative.

If no refund instructions are on file when a refund becomes due or if they are ambiguous, the EPO will on its own initiative establish whether it can make a refund to a deposit account held by the appointed professional representative or by the applicant (or appellant, if applicant/proprietor). Otherwise it will invite the person who made the payment to claim the refund online.

In the case of a refund of fees not payable by the applicant, proprietor or appellant (if applicant or proprietor), e.g. the opposition fee, the EPO will on its own initiative establish whether the refund can be credited to a deposit account. Otherwise it will invite the person who made the payment to claim the refund online.

Point 15 ADA10.3.2 Refunds to a bank account

If a refund cannot be made to a deposit account, the party to the proceedings is invited to claim the refund online via the EPO website (fee-payment.epo.org/refundepo.org) using a refund code provided in a non-public communication. Upon successful registration and sign in, the refund can be claimed by entering the application's details, the refund code and a bank account.10.4 Reallocation instead of refund

If a party files a written request, the payment may be reallocated instead of being refunded. The date of receipt of the reallocation instructions is then considered the payment date for the new purpose of payment.11. Crediting of fees under Rule 71a(5)

If, in response to an invitation under Rule 71(3), the applicant has already paid the fee for grant and publishing or the claims fees, the amount paid will be credited if a further such invitation is issued. This may happen where:

(i)the applicant requests amendments or corrections in response to the first Rule 71(3) communication or requests the reversal of amendments proposed by the examining division in that communication (see C‑V, 4.1) and also voluntarily pays the fee for grant and publishing and claims fees (even though this is not required, C‑V, 4.2) and the examining division then issues a subsequent Rule 71(3) communication (see C‑V, 4.6 and C-V, 4.7.2)

(ii)after the applicant has approved the text for grant in response to the first Rule 71(3) communication (which requires payment of the fee for grant and publishing and any claims fees due – see C‑V, 1.1), examination is resumed (see C‑V, 6.1) leading to a subsequent Rule 71(3) communication being issued (see C‑V, 6.2).

Rule 71a(5)

11.1 Crediting of the fee for grant and publishing

11.2 Crediting of claims fees

11.3 Separate crediting of the fee for grant and publishing and claims fees

11.4 Further processing fee and crediting of fees11.1 Crediting of the fee for grant and publishing

The amount of the fee for grant and publishing paid in response to the first Rule 71(3) communication is credited towards the amount of this same fee due in response to the second Rule 71(3) communication. If this fee increases between the first and second Rule 71(3) communications, the difference must be paid within the period for reply to the second Rule 71(3) communication.

For European patent applications filed before 1 April 2009 or international applications entering the European phase before that date, the fee for grant and publishing incorporates a fixed component and a component in respect of each page of the application in excess of 35 (see C‑V, 1.2 and A‑III, 13.2). If the overall fee changes between the first and second Rule 71(3) communication, any shortfall must be paid within the second Rule 71(3) period (e.g. resulting from a fee increase or an increase in the number of pages). Any excess will be refunded (for example where the version of the application on which the second Rule 71(3) communication is based has fewer pages than the earlier version on which the first Rule 71(3) communication was based).

Art. 2(2), item 7, RFees11.2 Crediting of claims fees

The amount of the claims fees paid in response to the first Rule 71(3) communication is credited towards the amount of the claims fees due in response to the second Rule 71(3) communication. In this regard it is important to note that, unlike claims fees paid on filing under Rule 45 or on entry into the European phase under Rule 162, it is not the number of claims paid for that is used in the calculation but rather the amount paid.

If the amount of the claims fees due increases between the first and second Rule 71(3) communications (e.g. because of an increase in the per-claim fee or in the number of claims or both), the difference must be paid within the period for reply to the second Rule 71(3) communication.

To calculate the amount of the claims fees due in response to the second Rule 71(3) communication, the number of fee-free claims (15) and also the number of claims fees paid on filing or on entry into the European phase are deducted from the number of claims on which both the first and second Rule 71(3) communications are based. Thereafter, the amount of the claims fees paid in response to the first Rule 71(3) communication is then credited towards (and so deducted from) the amount of the claims fees due in response to the second Rule 71(3) communication (if the amount of fees due after the second Rule 71(3) communication is smaller than that voluntarily paid after the first Rule 71(3) communication, see C‑V, 4.2).11.3 Separate crediting of the fee for grant and publishing and claims fees

The crediting of claims fees and the fee for grant and publishing is dealt with separately. Claims fees are not credited towards any increase in the fee for grant and publishing.11.4 Further processing fee and crediting of fees

Where the applicant has requested further processing in respect of the first Rule 71(3) communication (see E‑VIII, 2), the further processing fee is not credited towards any increase in the amount of the fees due in response to the second Rule 71(3) communication.

Nor is the further processing fee paid in respect of the first Rule 71(3) communication credited towards any subsequent request for further processing in respect of the second Rule 71(3) communication.Chapter XI – Inspection of files; communication of information contained in files; consultation of the European Patent Register; issue of certified copies

1. General

2. Inspection of files

3. Communication of information contained in the files

4. Consultation of the European Patent Register

5. Issue of certified copies1. General

After a European patent application has been published, any person may inspect and obtain information from the files relating to the application and the resultant European patent. Similarly, anybody may request the issue of a sample of biological material in accordance with Rule 33 (see A‑IV, 4.4).

The provisions governing file inspection are contained in Art. 128 and Rules 144 and 145 (see A‑XI, 2); those governing communication of information are contained in Rule 146 (see A‑XI, 3). For international (PCT) applications, see E‑IX, 2.10.

The European Patent Register, containing the particulars specified in Rule 143 and accessible free of charge, can be consulted to ascertain the state of the proceedings and the legal status of patent rights. It also provides access to the files of published European patent applications and patents for inspection (see A‑XI, 4). The inspection of paper files on the premises of the European Patent Office was discontinued in 2007.

On request, the EPO issues certified copies of documents contained in the files or of other documents (see A‑XI, 5).

Any fees payable for any of the above services are laid down by the President under Art. 3(1) RFees and are regularly published in the Official Journal. See also the schedule of fees and expenses on the EPO website (epo.org).

An administrative fee, if any, falls due when the request is received. The methods of payment and the date on which payment is deemed made are dealt with in the Rules relating to Fees (see A‑X, 2 and 4). Where the administrative fee has been duly paid, it will not be refunded (see A‑X, 10.1).

2.2 Conducting file inspections

2.3 Restrictions to file inspection

2.4 Confidentiality of the request

2.5 File inspection before publication of the application

2.6 Publication of bibliographic data before publication of the application2.1 Documents open to file inspection

All parts of the file compiled when conducting the examination, opposition and appeal procedure with the parties are open for inspection, subject to the restrictions mentioned below (see A‑XI, 2.3). This includes information on the dates of the start of search and examination, any invitations under Rule 63(1) or Rule 62a(1) and the search opinion, if applicable.

As regards application documents corrected under Rule 56a, see A‑II, 6 and the notice from the EPO dated 23 July 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A71.

Observations by third parties (Art. 115) are an integral part of the files and as such are open to inspection in accordance with Art. 128. A request by a third party to treat their observations or part of them confidentially cannot be granted. In such a case, the third party will be notified accordingly (see E‑VI, 3).

The parts of the file excluded from inspection (see A‑XI, 2.3) are kept separate from those open to inspection.

Art. 128 Rule 145(2) Rule 147(2)2.2 Conducting file inspections

The EPO President determines all file inspection arrangements, including the circumstances in which an administrative fee is payable (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 20 February 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A16).

As a rule, published patent applications and granted patents can be inspected in the European Patent Register, which is accessible free of charge via the EPO website. In exceptional cases, and only if accompanied by a substantiated request, uncertified paper copies of files or uncertified extracts from the European Patent Register are still issued. The corresponding administrative fees have been abolished (see the notice from the EPO dated 20 February 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A15, and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 20 February 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A16).

Regarding requests to furnish certified copies of documents from the file or a certified extract from the European Patent Register, see A‑XI, 5.

Rule 145(2) Art. 3(1) RFees2.3 Restrictions to file inspection

Inspection of files is subject to the restrictions laid down in Rule 144.

The parts of the file excluded from inspection are:

Art. 128(4) Rule 146 Rule 145 Rule 144

(i)the documents relating to the exclusion of or objections to members of the boards of appeal or of the Enlarged Board of Appeal

Rule 144(a)

(ii)draft decisions and opinions, and all other documents used for the preparation of decisions and opinions, which are not communicated to the parties

Rule 144(b)

(iii)the designation of the inventor if that party has waived the right to be mentioned as inventor under Rule 20(1)

Rule 144(c)

(iv)any other document excluded from inspection by the EPO President on the ground that such inspection would not serve the purpose of informing the public about the European patent application or the resulting patent; these include documents relating to file inspection and requests for accelerated search and accelerated examination under the "PACE" programme (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, J.3)

Rule 144(d)

(v)subject to Rule 94.2 and 94.3 PCT, the files relating to international preliminary examination for a Euro-PCT application in respect of which the EPO is the International Preliminary Examining Authority and for which an international preliminary examination report has not yet been established (see OJ EPO 2003, 382; see also E‑IX, 2.10).

Apart from listing the documents automatically excluded from file inspection by the EPO, the decision of the President referred to under point (iv) above stipulates that, on request, (parts of) other documents may be excluded from file inspection where their inspection is claimed to be prejudicial to the legitimate personal or economic interests of a natural or legal person. Any such request needs to be duly substantiated and specify how the legitimate personal or economic interests of the party are affected and what the relevant consequences are rather than merely making a statement concerning a party's interests in general. Also, any requests for exclusion from file inspection should be clearly marked, allowing them to be immediately identified as such and to be provisionally excluded from inspection, pending a final decision on the request.

When a submission is to be excluded from file inspection only partially, only the parts or passages in question are excluded; the rest of the submission remains public.

If it is decided that certain papers, either marked "confidential" or in view of the nature of their content, are not to be excluded from file inspection under Rule 144, they are returned to the sender (see T 516/89).

Art. 38(1) PCT Rule 94 PCT2.4 Confidentiality of the request

Correspondence in proceedings relating to the inspection of files conducted between the EPO and the person requesting the inspection is included in the non-public part of the file. The EPO does not provide the applicant with any information about the proceedings relating to the inspection of files (see A‑XI, 2.3(iv) but also A‑XI, 2.5, third paragraph).2.5 File inspection before publication of the application

Until the European patent application is published, the files may be inspected only by applicants or with their consent. The MyEPO Portfolio and My Files and MyEPO Portfolio services allow applicants to inspect the public part of the files relating to their still unpublished applications (see the notice from the EPO dated 13 December 2011, OJ EPO 2012, 22, and the decision of the President of the EPO and notice from the EPO both dated 9 October 2023 11 May 2022 concerning the web-based online service MyEPO Portfolio, OJ EPO 2022, A51 and OJ EPO 2022, A52 OJ EPO 2023, A89, and OJ EPO 2023, A90, respectively, as well as the notice from the EPO dated 3 May 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A50, and the notice from the EPO dated 13 December 2011, OJ EPO 2012, 22). If a third party requests file inspection without at the same time submitting the applicant's consent, the EPO will not release the files until the applicant's approval has been presented.

Art. 128(1)

However, prior to the European patent application's publication, any person who can prove that applicants have invoked their rights under the application against them may also inspect the files. The rights under a European patent application are also deemed to have been invoked where rights under a first filing in a contracting state have been invoked and the subsequent European patent application is mentioned at the same time (see J 14/91). If such proof is not furnished together with the request, the EPO will invite the requester within a specified period to supply proof. If that is not done in due time, the request will be refused.

If a request for inspection of the files under Art. 128(2) is made, the applicant is entitled to notification of the identity of the person making the request. Professional representatives requesting inspection of the files on behalf of a third party under Art. 128(2) must therefore give the third party's name and address and file an authorisation.

A decision on a request for inspection of the files under Art. 128(2) is only taken once the applicant has been heard. If the applicant objects and provides grounds for believing that the requirements under Art. 128(2) are not met within the period set by the EPO, a decision will be delivered. This decision is subject to appeal.

Art. 128(2)

Prior to a European divisional application's publication the file of this divisional application may be inspected only in the cases described in Art. 128(1) and Art. 128(2). This also applies where the parent application has already been published. However, where a European divisional application or a new European patent application filed under Art. 61(1)(b) is published, the files of the earlier application may be inspected prior to that earlier application's publication and without the relevant applicant's consent.

Art. 128(3)2.6 Publication of bibliographic data before publication of the application

In accordance with Art. 128(5), the EPO publishes in the European Patent Bulletin the bibliographic data relating to European patent applications that had been announced for publication but for which the application documents were not published, either because the application was withdrawn or because the announcement was erroneous. The lists of these publication numbers can be found on the European publication server, which is accessible via the EPO website (epo.org).

Art. 128(5)3. Communication of information contained in the files

Subject to the restrictions provided for in Art. 128(1) to Art. 128(4) and Rule 144 (see A‑XI, 2.3), the EPO may, upon request, communicate information concerning any file of a published European patent application or a European patent. This is subject to the payment of an administrative fee (see A‑XI, 1 and OJ EPO 2019, A14 and OJ EPO 2019, A15).

However, the EPO may refer to the option to obtain inspection of the file itself, should it deem this to be appropriate in view of the quantity of information to be supplied.

Correspondence in proceedings relating to the communication of information conducted between the EPO and the person requesting the information is filed in the part of the file that is not accessible to the public. The EPO does not provide the applicant with any information about the proceedings relating to the communication of information.

Rule 1464. Consultation of the European Patent Register

The European Patent Register can be accessed free of charge via the EPO website (epo.org) (see A‑XI, 2.2). Entries in the European Patent Register are made starting from the publication of the European patent application up to expiry of the period of opposition or the termination of opposition proceedings. Where applicable, the date and purport of any decision taken in revocation or limitation proceedings (Art. 105b(2)) and/or on a petition for review (Art. 112a) are also included (Rule 143(1)(x) and Rule 143(1)(y)). Since the correction of the designation of the inventor may be made at any time (see A‑III, 5.5), there is no time restriction for related entries in the European Patent Register.

Apart from the data to be entered under Rule 143(1), the European Patent Register includes, under Rule 143(2), additional application and procedural data not published in the European Patent Bulletin (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 15 July 2014, OJ EPO 2014, A86). Register data may also be obtained by telephone from Customer Services: epo.org/service-support/contact-us.html. In exceptional cases, an extract from the Register will be provided on receipt of a substantiated request (see OJ EPO 2019, A15).

Art. 127 Rule 143 Rule 21(2)5. Issue of certified copies

5.1 Certified copies of documents from the files or of other documents

5.2 Priority documents issued by the EPO5.1 Certified copies of documents from the files or of other documents

The EPO will issue on request a certified copy of the European patent application or European patent specification, or of other documents from the files of European patent applications and patents (e.g. an extract from the European Patent Register), provided that the conditions for file inspection (Art. 128(1) to Art. 128(4)) are fulfilled and an administrative fee has been paid (see A‑XI, 1 and OJ EPO 2019, A14 OJ EPO 2023, A3).

A certified copy of the European patent certificate with specification attached is supplied to the patent proprietor on request (see C‑V, 12).

Rule 745.2 Priority documents issued by the EPO

Any priority document (i.e. the certified copy of the European patent application together with the certificate stating its filing date) will only be issued to the (original) applicant or that party's successor in title on written request. If such request is missing, the EPO will invite the requester to file it and will supply the certified copy only once this requirement has been fulfilled. In the case of applications filed in a language other than an official EPO language (Art. 14(2)), the priority document relates to the application as originally filed, not to the translation in one of the official EPO languages.

The EPO President determines all necessary arrangements, including the form of the priority document and the circumstances in which an administrative fee is payable (see A‑XI, 1 and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 20 February 2019 on the inspection of files, OJ EPO 2019, A16). The content of priority documents corresponds to the application documents as available on the filing date and as contained in the electronic file, reproduced in black and white (see A‑IX, 1.2 and 7.1 and the notice from the EPO dated 14 January 2020, OJ EPO 2020, A7).

Where a European patent application claims the priority of a previous European patent application or an international application filed with the EPO as receiving Office under the PCT, a certified copy of the previous application will be included in the file free of charge. Furthermore, if the patent office at which a European priority document is to be filed participates in the WIPO Digital Access Service (DAS), it is possible for that office to retrieve the European priority document free of charge via DAS by providing the access code that the EPO generates for every European patent application filed with it and every international application filed with the EPO as receiving Office (see also A‑III, 6.7).

Rule 54Part B Guidelines for Search

ContentsChapter I – Introduction

1. Scope of Part B

2. Search division1. Scope of Part B

Part B is about European searches, i.e. searches the EPO search divisions perform for European patent applications. They also carry out other types of search (see B‑II, 4.4 to B‑II, 4.6). These include searches under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which are dealt with in the PCT Search and Examination Guidelines and in Part B of the Guidelines for Search and Examination at the EPO as PCT Authority.2. Search division

The search division is responsible for:

– drafting extended European search reports, i.e. European search reports under Art. 92 and accompanying search opinions under Rule 62(1)

– drafting all of the different types of search report referred to in B‑I, 1 and B‑II, 4

– issuing any invitation under Rule 62a(1) (see also B‑VIII, 4) to clarify – or, where necessary, limit the subject-matter to be searched

– issuing any invitation under Rule 63(1) (see B‑VIII, 3.1).

In cases of lack of unity, it also draws up a partial search report and a provisional opinion on the patentability of the invention or unitary group of inventions first mentioned in the claims (see F‑V, 3.4), which includes the reasons for the non-unity findings, and issues an invitation to pay further search fees under Rule 64(1) or Rule 164(1) (see B‑VII, 1.2 and B‑XI, 5).

The member of the search division responsible for the search on a European application is normally also the first member of the examining division for that application.

Art. 17 Art. 18

2.1 Consultation with other examiners

2.2 Search division has more than one member2.1 Consultation with other examiners

The search division may consult other examiners for advice on various issues, for example:

(i)searching in databases it is not familiar with

(ii)understanding aspects of the claimed invention outside its area of technical expertise

(iii)devising a search strategy (see also B‑I, 2.2)

(iv)assessing the relevance of a prior-art document for determining the patentability of claimed subject-matter (see B‑X, 9.2).2.2 Search division has more than one member

A special search division consisting of two, or possibly even three, members may be formed where the nature of the invention makes it necessary to search in very different specialist fields, for example because the "person skilled in the art" in the relevant technical field has to be regarded as being more than one person (see G‑VII, 3).

This may also happen where subject-matter covering different technical fields is found to lack unity.

When the search division is enlarged this way, all the documents found in the various technical fields by its different members are included in the same search report. However, only one member draws up the search opinion, albeit in consultation with the members with expertise in the other technical fields where necessary.

2.2.1 Where claimed unitary subject-matter covers more than one technical field

2.2.2 Further searches in a different technical field for a non-unitary application2.2.1 Where claimed unitary subject-matter covers more than one technical field

Exceptionally, where the subject-matter of an application covers two or more technical fields which are so different that a member trained to carry out searches in one field cannot reasonably be expected to search all of them, two or possibly even more members may share responsibility for drawing up the search report.

The skills needed to carry out a satisfactory search in a particular technical field include:

(a)the technical knowledge and training required to properly understand the claimed subject-matter

(b)expertise in using the appropriate search tools.

If the subject-matter of the application extends over different technical fields, it may be appropriate to enlarge the search division to include a second and possibly even more members who are specialised in those fields.

In all the above cases, the search report and search opinion (if applicable ‒ see B‑XI, 7) are usually issued by one member only.2.2.2 Further searches in a different technical field for a non-unitary application

The search division may also have more than one member where subject-matter in different technical fields is found to lack of unity. Such cases are handled as follows:

(a)The first member carries out a search on the invention first mentioned in the claims (see F‑V, 3.4) in one technical field and draws up a search opinion (if applicable – see B‑XI, 7) on this first invention and the reasons for the lack of unity. The applicant is sent a partial search report (see B‑VII, 1.1), along with an invitation to pay further search fees for the inventions that are in another technical field.

(b)The applicant pays further search fees for the inventions they want to have searched (see B‑VII, 1.2.1).

(c)A second member specialised in the relevant technical field searches the other inventions for which fees were paid.

(d)The second member adds an opinion on the additionally searched inventions to the first member's opinion on unity and the first invention.

In very exceptional cases, more than one other member (i.e. also a third or possibly even more members) will be needed to search the other invention or inventions for which fees have been paid, but the procedure followed is the same.Chapter II – General

1. Search and substantive examination

2. Aim of the search

3. Search documentation

4. Search report1. Search and substantive examination

The procedure a European patent application goes through from its filing to the grant of a patent (or the refusal of the application) has two separate main stages, i.e. the search and substantive examination.

Art. 17 Art. 18

1.1 Contact between the applicant and the search division1.1 Contact between the applicant and the search division

Consultations with the search division can only take place after the application has entered the examination stage, except in the cases mentioned in B‑VIII, 3.2.2 and 4.2.2, and for issues related to the timing of the search report. The search division must not consent to earlier consultations (see also B‑XI, 8) and must instead tell applicants that any issues they wish to raise will be dealt with in examination. For the procedure at the examination stage, see C‑VII, 2.5.2. Aim of the search

The search is aimed at identifying the state of the art relevant for determining whether, and if so to what extent, the claimed invention is new and involves an inventive step.

It is not usually aimed at finding disclosures of potential interest to the applicant, but documents not directly relevant for assessing the patentability of the claimed invention may be cited in the search report in certain circumstances (see B‑X, 9.2.2 and B-X, 9.2.5).

Both the content of the search opinion and the later substantive examination depend on the outcome of the search as it establishes what state of the art is to be taken as the basis for assessing the patentability of the invention. The search must therefore be as complete and effective as possible, within the limitations necessarily imposed by unity of invention and other factors (see B‑III, 2, B‑VII and B‑VIII).

Rule 61(1)3. Search documentation

The search is carried out in in-house or external document collections or databases. Their contents can be accessed systematically, e.g. using keywords, classification symbols or indexing codes. The available documentation consists largely of patent documents but also includes non-patent literature, such as articles from periodicals (see B‑IX).4. Search report

The search report contains the results of the search and, in particular, identifies the documents forming the relevant state of the art (see B‑X, 9).

Art. 92 Rule 61(1)

It informs the applicant, the EPO examining divisions and ‒ once published ‒ the public of the relevant state of the art.

It is accompanied by a search opinion (see B‑XI; except in the cases mentioned in B‑XI, 7) and, together, they make up the extended European search report (EESR).

Art. 92 Art. 93(1)

4.1 European searches

4.2 Additional European searches

4.3 Supplementary European searches

4.4 International (PCT) searches

4.5 International-type searches

4.6 Searches on national applications4.1 European searches

The main task of the EPO's search divisions is to carry out searches and draw up search reports for European patent applications. However, they may also be called on to perform the various other types of search listed below.

Art. 174.2 Additional European searches

An additional search may be necessary once a European patent application reaches the examination stage, for example because:

(i)the claims have been amended and now encompass subject-matter not covered by the original search (see, however, C‑III, 3.2.1 and H‑II, 6.1 on claims not searched because of a lack of unity and H‑IV, 4.1.2 on amendments introducing subject-matter from the description and so resulting in claims defining subject-matter which is not linked to the originally searched subject-matter by a single general inventive concept).

(ii)the deficiencies which resulted in an incomplete search or the issue of a declaration replacing a search report under Rule 63 or a declaration under Art. 17(2)(a) PCT or Art. 17(2)(b) PCT (see B‑VIII and C‑IV, 7.3) have been overcome by amendments or been rebutted during substantive examination.

Rule 63 Art. 17(2) PCT

(iii)the examining division has reversed the search division's opinion on novelty or lack of inventive step (see B‑III, 1.1) or on other issues (see B‑III, 1.2), in particular lack of unity of invention (see B‑VII), subject-matter to be excluded from the search (see B‑III, 3.11 and B‑VIII) or Rule 62a.

(iv)the original search was limited or suffered from imperfections.

The examining division will use any new documents found in an additional search if it considers them relevant for examining the application. It must then make copies available to the applicant (Art. 113(1)).

Similarly, an additional search may be needed if a granted European patent is opposed (see D‑VI, 5).

Rule 64 Rule 62a4.3 Supplementary European searches

An international (PCT) application for which the EPO acts as designated Office or elected Office and which has been accorded an international filing date is deemed to be a European patent application. Where an international (PCT) search report is already available, it will replace the European search report. The search division will then draw up a supplementary European search report or issue a declaration replacing it under Rule 63 except in cases where the Administrative Council has decided that it can be dispensed with (see B‑II, 4.3.1).

The (S)ISA/IPEA (other than the EPO) will have given opinions on the novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability of the claimed invention under Art. 33(1) PCT and possibly also on unity of invention under Art. 34(3) PCT and any subject-matter to be excluded from the international search/preliminary examination under Art. 17(2) PCT/Art. 34(4) PCT. The search division will consider these opinions but is free to diverge from them in its supplementary European search report and its search opinion (if applicable – see B‑XI, 7).

The search division can use the documents cited in the international search report to support its findings (e.g. lack of novelty) in the search opinion (if applicable – see B‑XI, 7).

Art. 153(2), Art. 153(6) and Art. 153(7)

4.3.1 Dispensing with the supplementary European search report

4.3.2 A supplementary European search report is required

4.3.3 Application documents for the supplementary European search report4.3.1 Dispensing with the supplementary European search report

The Administrative Council has decided that no supplementary European search report is to be drawn up for an international application if:

(i)the EPO was the ISA or the SISA (OJ EPO 2009, 594; OJ EPO 2010, 316)

(ii)the Swedish Intellectual Property Office, the Austrian Patent Office or the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office was the ISA and it was filed before 1 July 2005 (OJ EPO 1979, 248; OJ EPO 1995, 511; OJ EPO 2012, 212 and OJ EPO 2012, 219).

The search fee may be reduced in these cases (see A‑X, 9.3.1).4.3.2 A supplementary European search report is required

If a supplementary European search report is required (see B‑II, 4.3.1), the supplementary European search will generally be carried out in the same way as a European search. Any limitation is left to the search division's discretion; a fixed approach to this is not possible since the search practices at other ISAs are not fully harmonised with those of the EPO and the documentation available to them may differ too.

The EPO generally aims to avoid any unnecessary duplication of work and so relies on the efficiency and quality of the international searches as far as possible. If the international search report has not yet been drawn up when the application enters the European phase, the EPO will wait until it is available before starting to process the application. The EPO as designated Office requests the ISA or the SISA to supply, together with the international search report, copies of the documents cited in it (Art. 20(3) PCT, see also Rule 44.3(a) PCT or Rule 45bis.7(c) PCT). If a cited document is not in one of the EPO's official languages and the search division needs a translation into one of them, it provides this itself (e.g. a patent family member or an abstract of the document in an official language, see B‑VI, 6.2) unless it can obtain it from another source, e.g. the applicant or the ISA.4.3.3 Application documents for the supplementary European search report

The European grant procedure, including the supplementary European search, is based on the application documents specified by the applicant when the application enters the European phase (Rule 159(1)(b)). However, if the applicant amends the application within a non-extendable period of six months from notification of a communication under Rule 161(2) (see E‑IX, 3), the amended application will be taken as the basis for the supplementary European search instead (see also B‑XI, 2). For procedures relating to Euro-PCT applications where no supplementary European search report is drawn up by the EPO, see E‑IX, 3.2, E-IX, 3.3 and E-IX, 3.4.

Rule 159(1)(b) Rule 1614.4 International (PCT) searches

For the practice as regards international (PCT) searches, see the PCT International Search and Preliminary Examination Guidelines and the latest version of the EPO's guide for applicants entitled "Euro-PCT Guide: PCT procedure at the EPO", which is available at epo.org.4.5 International-type searches

Under the PCT, the EPO, as an ISA, may be entrusted with carrying out "international-type searches" for national patent applications (Art. 15(5) PCT). These searches are by definition similar to international searches, and the same considerations apply, except where the national application searched is found to lack unity of invention, in which case no reasoned statement on this finding is included in the search report and no invitation to pay further search fees is issued. However, it may be possible for applicants to pay these fees directly to the national offices. Where a written opinion is issued, it is drafted in accordance with EPO practice under PCT Chapter I and does include a reasoned statement on any potential lack-of-unity objection.4.6 Searches on national applications

The EPO search divisions also carry out searches on national applications for some of the EPC contracting states. These Guidelines are not necessarily fully applicable to these national searches and do not always give details of how they differ from European searches. However, national and European searches are largely identical and at any rate compatible.

Prot. Centr. I(1)(b)Chapter III – Characteristics of the search

1. Opinions of the search division

2. Scope of the search

3. The subject-matter of the search1. Opinions of the search division

1.1 Opinions in relation to the search report

1.2 Opinions on matters relating to limitation of the search1.1 Opinions in relation to the search report

The aim of the search is to identify the state of the art relevant for assessing novelty and inventive step (see B‑II, 2). Decisions on novelty and inventive step are the responsibility of the examining divisions, but the search division already gives the applicant a reasoned assessment of whether the application and the claimed invention meet the EPC requirements in the search opinion (if applicable ‒ see B‑XI, 7). The applicant can then reply to this in the examination proceedings (Art. 113(1) and B‑XI, 8). The categories the search division assigns to the documents cited in the search report (see B‑X, 9.2) similarly amount to implicit opinions on patentability and are subject to review by the examining division at the examination stage (see B‑II, 4.2(iii) and B‑XI, 1.2), in particular in the light of the applicant's reply (see B‑XI, 8).

The assessment of patentability at the search stage can have a direct bearing on how the search itself is carried out: see B‑III, 3.8 (on searching the subject-matter of dependent claims), B‑III, 2.3 (on searching in neighbouring technical fields) and B‑IV, 2.6 (on stopping the search when only trivial subject-matter remains).

Rule 61(1)1.2 Opinions on matters relating to limitation of the search

Occasionally, matters of substantive examination other than novelty or inventive step have a direct bearing on how the search is carried out and may result in its limitation. The search division's opinions on theses matters are likewise subject to review by the examining division (see T 178/84 and T 631/97, and B‑II, 4.2(iii) and B‑XI, 1.2), in particular in the light of the applicant's reply to the search opinion (see B‑XI, 8).

See B‑VII (Unity of invention) and B‑VIII (Subject-matter to be excluded from the search) for examples.2. Scope of the search

2.1 Completeness of the search

2.2 Effectiveness and efficiency of the search

2.3 Search in neighbouring fields

2.4 Internet searches2.1 Completeness of the search

A European search is essentially a thorough, all-encompassing search carried out to a high quality standard. Nevertheless, a search of this kind cannot always be 100% complete, in particular because all information retrieval systems, however they are operated, are inevitably imperfect. The search is carried out in a way that minimises the risk of overlooking complete anticipations of any claims, or other highly relevant prior art. Given the sheer amount of material on less relevant prior art that is available in the document collection, it is acceptable if not all of it is found (however, see also B‑III, 2.3). For limitations of the subject-matter searched, see B‑VIII.

The scope of the international search is defined in Art. 15(4) PCT, which states that the ISA must endeavour to discover as much of the relevant prior art as its facilities permit and must, in any case, consult the minimum documentation specified in Rule 34 PCT. It follows from this definition ("as much … as its facilities permit") that international searches must be equivalent in scope to a European search and must be carried out to the same high quality standard. This means that, if the EPO carried out the international search or the supplementary international search, it does not need to draw up a supplementary European search report and its international search report can replace the European search report (Art. 153(6) EPC, see OJ EPO 2010, 316, and OJ EPO 2011, 616; see also B‑II, 4.3).2.2 Effectiveness and efficiency of the search

The effectiveness and efficiency of any search for relevant documents (Rule 61(1)) depend on the degree of order which is inherent in, or which can be applied to, the searched document collection as it is this order that enables the search division to determine which parts of the documentation to consult. The basic means of creating order in a document collection are words, classification units, indexing codes or bibliographical links. The order can be permanent, as with indexing words or codes and classification symbols, or it can be created on demand by a search strategy judiciously using the basic means mentioned above to identify the parts of the documentation that are likely to contain material relevant to the invention. To ensure its resources are deployed as efficiently as possible, the search division, drawing on its knowledge of the technology in question and the available search tools, uses its judgement to omit parts of the documentation in which it is unlikely that any relevant documents will be found, for example parts containing documents from before the area of technology in question began to develop. Similarly, it only needs to consult one member of a patent family unless it has good reason to suppose that, in a particular case, there are relevant substantial differences in the content of different members of the same family (see B‑IX, 2.4).2.3 Search in neighbouring fields

The search division carries out the search in document collections and databases in which it can expect to find material covering all the technical fields directly relevant to the invention. The search strategy determines which parts of this documentation should be consulted. The scope of the search may then have to be extended to parts covering neighbouring fields, but it is for the search division to decide in each individual case whether this is necessary in view of what it has already found in the initially consulted parts (see B‑III, 3.2).

When deciding which technical fields are to be regarded as neighbouring in a particular case, the search division has to consider what appears to be the invention's essential technical contribution and not only the specific functions expressly mentioned in the application.

It is left to the search division's discretion whether to widen its search to include fields not mentioned in the application. In deciding on this, it does not put itself in the inventor's shoes and does not try to imagine every single possible application of the invention. The most important question guiding its decision is whether searching in neighbouring fields is likely to uncover material on which a reasonable inventive-step objection could be based (see T 176/84, T 195/84 and G‑VII, 3).2.4 Internet searches

The search can also cover internet sources, including online technical journals, online databases or other websites (see OJ EPO 2009, 456). The scope of any search on the internet will depend on the specific case, but there are some technical fields, especially in the area of information or software technology, where the most relevant prior art is unlikely to be found without systematically searching there. The search division may use the internet even when searching unpublished applications but must bear its duty to keep them confidential in mind and take great care to ensure that its search terms do not inadvertently disclose any confidential information about the invention. It is up to the search division to select suitable keywords that will enable it to search the invention effectively without disclosing it. This means, for example, not entering long portions of a claim's wording as a search term.

On the dating of internet citations, see G‑IV, 7.5.3. The subject-matter of the search

3.1 Basis for the search

3.2 Interpretation of claims

3.3 Amended claims, missing parts (Rule 56) or erroneously filed application documents or parts (Rule 56a)

3.4 Abandoned claims

3.5 Anticipation of amendments to claims

3.8 Search on dependent claims

3.9 Combination of elements in a claim

3.10 Different categories

3.11 Subject-matter excluded from search

3.12 Lack of unity

3.13 Technological background3.1 Basis for the search

The search is carried out on the basis of the claims, with due regard to the description and any drawings (Art. 92). The claims determine the extent of the protection the European patent will confer if granted (Art. 69(1)).

Art. 92 Art. 69(1) Rule 43(6)3.2 Interpretation of claims

The search is not restricted by the literal wording of the claims but also not broadened to include everything that a person skilled in the art might envisage from considering the description and drawings. The search division may need to consider the contents of the description and/or drawings when performing the search in order to:

(i)identify the technical problem and its solution

(ii)define unclear terms not defined in the claims

(iii)define clear terms given a definition different from their usual meaning

(iv)ascertain whether there is a fallback position.

The aim of the search is to identify prior art which is relevant to novelty and/or inventive step (see B‑II, 2). The search covers what appear to be the invention's essential features and is adapted to take account of any changes in the (objective) technical problem solved by the invention that may later arise in view of the prior art found so far (see B‑IV, 2.3 and B-IV, 2.4 and G‑VII, 5.2).

When interpreting claims for the purpose of the search, the search division will also consider any prior art comprising technical features which are well-known equivalents of the technical features of the claimed invention and which may mean it lacks inventive step (see G‑VII, Annex, 1.1(ii)).

Art. 92

3.2.1 Claims with explicit references to the description or drawings

3.2.2 Using the description and/or drawings to identify the technical problem

3.2.3 Using the description and/or drawings to define unclear terms not defined in the claims

3.2.4 Using the description and/or drawings to define clear terms given a definition different from their usual meaning

3.2.5 Ascertaining whether there is a fallback position3.2.1 Claims with explicit references to the description or drawings

Although explicit references in the claims to features elucidated in the description or in the drawings are only permissible where "absolutely necessary" (Rule 43(6) – see also B‑III, 3.5 and F‑IV, 4.17), claims containing such references are still searched if these features are unambiguously defined by specific parts of the description.

However, where the reference does not clearly identify which subject-matter of the description and/or drawings is to be regarded as included in the claim, an invitation under Rule 63(1) is issued. In the special case of an "omnibus claim" (e.g. one reading: "The invention substantially as herein described"), no invitation under Rule 63(1) is issued, and the search report will subsequently be treated as complete. This means that this kind of subject-matter will be dealt with only during examination.

The same procedure is followed regardless of whether or not the reference to the drawings and/or the description is allowable under Rule 43(6). In either case, the claim will have the same scope: if the reference is not allowable, the applicant will be asked to copy the definition of the technical feature from the description and/or drawings into the claim; if it is allowable, the claim will stay as it is.

However, where the reference does not appear to be allowable under Rule 43(6), the search division will object to it in the search opinion (if applicable – see B‑XI, 7).3.2.2 Using the description and/or drawings to identify the technical problem

Rule 42(1)(c) states that the description must (at least implicitly) mention the technical problem the invention is intended to solve (see also F‑II, 4.5). This means the technical problem can be identified even if it is not immediately apparent from the claims.

However, the technical problem may change in view of the prior art found (see G‑VII, 5.3, H‑V, 2.4 and T 39/93, OJ EPO 1997, 134; see also G‑VII, 5.2, T 184/82, OJ EPO 1984, 261, and T 732/89).3.2.3 Using the description and/or drawings to define unclear terms not defined in the claims

Sometimes, the terms used to define claimed technical features are unclear and so the scope of the claims cannot be determined unambiguously. The search division then uses the description and/or drawings to interpret what these terms mean (see F‑IV, 4.2).

For example:

Claim 1: Pneumatic tyre comprising a wide groove disposed in a tread portion, characterised in that the wide groove is provided on the groove bottom with at least one longitudinal rib extending in the longitudinal direction of the wide groove.

Description: The term "wide", as used in the context of the present invention, means not less than 20mm wide.

The term "wide" in claim 1 is unclear because it is a relative term with no well-defined meaning in the technical field, and so the scope of the claim is also unclear (F‑IV, 4.6, Art. 84). However, the description unambiguously defines "wide" as meaning "not less than 20mm wide". The search division takes this definition into account during the search (and subsequently objects to the clarity of the term "wide" under Art. 84, second sentence, in the search opinion). The definition of "wide" in the description is also a fallback position (see B‑III, 3.2.5).3.2.4 Using the description and/or drawings to define clear terms given a definition different from their usual meaning

The meaning given to a technical term in the description and/or the drawings sometimes differs from the one commonly accepted in the relevant technical field. The meaning given can make the term (and so the scope of the claim) broader (see Example 1) or narrower (see Example 2).

Example 1

Claim 1: Halide salt of compound A

"Halide salt" normally means fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide salt.

Description: In the context of the present invention the term halide salt means fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide or tosylate salt.

Here, the claim at first appears to be clear because it uses a technical term ("halide salt") that has a clear and well-established meaning in the relevant technical field. However, the description gives this term a broader meaning than its well-established definition (i.e. it also includes tosylate salt).

Example 2

As in Example 1, except that the description defines "halide salt" as meaning fluoride, chloride or bromide salt.

Here, the meaning of "halide salt" is narrower than its well-established definition (i.e. it does not cover iodide salt).

In both cases, the search will take into account both the term's generally accepted definition in the relevant technical field and its definition in the application itself.3.2.5 Ascertaining whether there is a fallback position

Claims sometimes contain an unclear and undefined term for which a clear preferred embodiment (i.e. a "fallback position"; see B‑III, 3.2(iv)) is given only in the description and/or drawings (see B‑III, 3.2.3). The search will then be based on the broadest technically sensible interpretation of the term. However, if the term's meaning is so unclear that a meaningful search cannot be carried out, it is justified to limit the scope of the search under Rule 63.3.3 Amended claims, missing parts (Rule 56) or erroneously filed application documents or parts (Rule 56a)

3.3.1 General considerations

3.3.2 Specific rules applicable to Euro-PCT applications3.3.1 General considerations

Where a European application does not derive from an earlier international application, the applicant is not allowed to amend the claims before receiving the European search report (Rule 137(1)). This means that the search is carried out on the basis of the claims in the European application as originally filed or of any set of claims filed under Rule 57(c) or Rule 58.

Search and examination will be based on the filing date and the application documents established during the procedure under Rule 56 or Rule 56a. These documents are considered the documents as originally filed within the meaning of Art. 123(2). If they the application documents used for the search contain missing parts of the description and/or missing drawings filed under Rule 56(3), the application including the missing parts will form the basis for the search. In cases where erroneously filed documents and correct documents are both part of the application as filed (i.e. in cases under Rule 56a(4) of corrections without a change in the filing date), the search will be performed as usual, and the procedures under Rule 63 or Rule 64 applied where appropriate. or correct application documents or parts filed under Rule 56a(4) (see H‑IV, 2.2.3) and If the EPO has already begun to draw up the search report when correct documents are filed, the applicant will be invited to pay a further search fee (Rule 56a(8)) (see A‑II, 6.7).

In addition, when the search division expects the application to be redated by the examining division later on in the proceedings (see C‑III, 1), it checks whether the Receiving Section's assessment of the "completely contained" criterion was correct (see H‑IV, 2.2.2). If the Receiving Section wrongly considered that the missing parts and/or elements or the correct parts and/or elements were completely contained in the priority document, the search will be widened to include documents which would be relevant if the application were to be redated (such documents can be cited as "L" documents in the European search report (see also B‑XI, 2.1)) to cover prior art which will be relevant for assessing the novelty and inventive step of the claimed subject-matter as at the possible new filing date (see also B‑XI, 2.1). The same applies to Euro-PCT applications which contain missing parts of the description, drawings or claims and/or missing elements filed under Rule 20.6 PCT.

Rule 56 Rule 56a Rule 137(1)3.3.2 Specific rules applicable to Euro-PCT applications

Where a European application derives from an earlier international application, the applicant may have amended the international application in the international phase, either after receiving the international search report (Art. 19(1) PCT) or during international preliminary examination (Art. 34(2)(b) PCT). Under Rule 159(1)(b), the applicant can then choose whether to enter the European phase with these amended application documents (including claims) or with the ones originally filed. The EPO also gives them an opportunity to amend the application documents (including the claims) within a set time limit (Rule 161(2), see E‑IX, 3). The application as amended is then taken as the basis for any supplementary European search to be carried out under Art. 153(7) (see B‑II, 4.3 and B‑XI, 2).

See B‑VIII, 6 for the procedure followed where the claims of an international application entering the European (regional) phase are amended in such a way that they contravene Art. 123(2).

Rule 159(1)(b) Rule 1613.4 Abandoned claims

Claims in a European patent application that are deemed to have been abandoned because the fees for them were not paid must be excluded from the search. The claims which have actually been searched are specified in the search report. This applies both to searches on directly filed European patent applications and to supplementary European searches on Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase (see B‑II, 4.3).

Rule 45(3) Rule 162(4)3.5 Anticipation of amendments to claims

In principle, and in so far as possible and reasonable, the search covers all the subject-matter to which the claims are directed or to which they might reasonably be expected to be directed if they are amended (see, however, B‑VII, 1.3 on cases of lack of unity and H‑IV, 4 on the ambit of Rule 137(5)).

Example

Where an application relating to an electric circuit contains one or more claims directed only to the function and manner of operation, and the description and drawings include an example detailing a non-trivial transistor circuit, the search includes this circuit.

However, it is not sufficient for the application as filed to contain one broadly worded independent claim covering several embodiments, and no dependent claims, for the applicant to be entitled to a search of all the features of those embodiments (see T 1679/10).3.6 Broad claims

The search division does not have to make any special effort to search unduly wide or speculative claims beyond the subject-matter that is sufficiently disclosed in the application (Art. 83) and supported by the description (Art. 84).

Example 1

If the claims in an application that relates to an automatic telephone exchange and describes it in detail are directed to an automatic communication switching centre, the search is not widened to include automatic telegraph exchanges, data switching centres, etc. merely because the claims are broadly worded but only if it is probable that it will then produce a document on which a reasonable novelty or inventive-step objection could be based.

Example 2

If a claim is directed to a process for manufacturing an "impedance element" but the description and drawings relate only to the manufacture of a resistor element, and do not indicate how other types of impedance element could be manufactured by the claimed process, widening the search to include, say, the manufacture of capacitors is normally not justified.

Example 3

If the main claim relates to the chemical treatment of a substrate, but it appears from the description or all the examples that the problem to be solved depends solely on the nature of natural leather, the search is normally not widened to cover the fields of plastics, fabrics or glass.

Example 4

If the description and drawings are directed to a lock with a safety cylinder but the claims refer to a device allowing the indexation of the angular position of a first element with respect to two other rotating elements, then the search is limited to locks.

In exceptional cases where there is such a lack of disclosure or support that a meaningful search over the whole scope of the claims is impossible, it may make sense to follow the procedure under Rule 63 and issue either a partial search report or a declaration replacing the search report (see B‑VIII, 3).

Art. 83 Art. 843.7 Independent and dependent claims

The search carried out in the documentation to be consulted for the independent claim or claims must also cover all dependent claims (for cases not complying with Rule 43(2), see B‑VIII, 4). Dependent claims are ones which are restricted by all the features of the claim or claims on which they depend. So, where the subject-matter of an independent claim is novel, that of its dependent claims will also be novel (see, however, F‑VI, 2.4.3). When the patentability of the subject-matter of the independent claim is not in doubt after the search, there is no need to carry out a further search or cite documents for the subject-matter of the dependent claims as such (see, however, B‑II, 4.2(iii) and B‑XI, 1.2).

Example 1

An application relating to cathode ray oscilloscope tubes has an independent claim directed to specific means along the edge of the front of the tube for illuminating the screen and a dependent claim directed to a specific connection between the front and the main part of the tube. When searching in the parts of the documentation consulted for the illumination means, the search division will also look for material relating to the connecting means, whether in combination with the illumination means or not. But, if its search in these parts of the documentation does not cast any doubt on the patentability of the illuminating means, it will not continue the search on the connecting means in other parts of the documentation which are likely to contain material relevant to or dealing specifically with these connections.

Example 2

An application dealing with a pharmaceutical composition for treating nail infections has an independent claim relating to specific combinations of the active ingredients The patentability of this claim's subject-matter is not in doubt after the search, so there is no need to continue the search in relation to dependent claims dealing with the use of a specific volatile organic solvent as a carrier in the composition.

Rule 43(4)3.8 Search on dependent claims

However, where there is doubt about whether the independent claim's subject-matter is patentable, the search may have to be continued in other parts of the documentation, e.g. in one or more additional classification units, in order to assess whether the subject-matter of the dependent claim as such is novel and involves an inventive step. No special search is carried out for features that seem prima facie trivial or are generally known in the art. However, a handbook or other document showing that a feature is generally known can be cited if it can be found quickly (see G‑VII, 6(iii)). A dependent claim that adds another feature (instead of providing more detail on something already in the independent claim) has to be considered in combination with the features in the independent claim and is dealt with accordingly (see F‑IV, 3.4).3.9 Combination of elements in a claim

For claims characterised by a combination of elements (e.g. A, B and C), the search is aimed at finding prior art relating to the combination. However, when searching the parts of the documentation selected for this, the search division should also search them for sub-combinations, including the elements individually (e.g. A and B, A and C, B and C, and also A, B and C separately). Other parts of the documentation are searched either for sub-combinations or for individual elements of the combination only if this is still necessary for establishing the novelty of the element in order to assess whether the combination involves an inventive step.3.10 Different categories

If the application contains different categories of claims, the search must cover all of them (for cases not complying with Rule 43(2), see B‑VIII, 4). However, if a product claim clearly seems to be both new and non-obvious, the search division will not carry out any special search on claims for a process which inevitably results in the manufacture of that product or for use of the product (see F‑IV, 3.8 and G‑VII, 13). When the application contains only claims of one category, it may make sense to include other categories in the search. For example, it can generally be assumed, i.e. unless the application contains contrary information, that, in a claim directed to a chemical process, the starting products form part of the state of the art and need not be searched. The intermediate products will only be searched if they are the subject-matter of one or more claims. The final products on the other hand will always have to be searched unless they are clearly known.3.11 Subject-matter excluded from search

The search division can decide to exclude certain subject-matter from its search. It may do this where the subject-matter falls under one of the exceptions to patentability laid down in the EPC or cannot be considered susceptible to industrial application (see B‑VIII, 1 and B-VIII, 2). It may also do this where the application falls so short of other EPC requirements that it is impossible to carry out a meaningful search on some or all of the claims or part of a claim (see B‑VIII, 3) or where the application does not comply with Rule 43(2) (see B‑VIII, 4).

Rule 63 Rule 62a3.12 Lack of unity

Where the claims do not relate to a single invention only ‒ or to a group of inventions that are so closely linked that they form a single general inventive concept ‒ the search will normally be restricted to the invention or linked group of inventions first mentioned in the claims (see B‑VII and F‑V, 3.4). If the search is restricted this way, the applicant will be informed in a communication accompanying the partial search report (see B‑VII, 1.2).

Rule 643.13 Technological background

It makes sense to widen the scope of the search to include the following "technological background" to the invention:

– the preamble to the first claim, i.e. the part coming before the expression "characterised by" or "characterised in that"

– any state of the art which the introductory part of the description says is known but which is not identified by specific citations

– the general technological background to the invention (often called "general state of the art").Chapter IV – Search procedure and strategy

1. Procedure before searching

2. Search strategy

3. Procedure after searching1. Procedure before searching

Starting the workflow for a European search report, a European search opinion or a clarification request under Rule 62a and/or Rule 63(1) triggers a pre-search algorithm that generates a list of documents to be inspected by the search division. This creates a marker in the file showing that the search division has started the search. The date when the search started will be relevant if the search fee has to be refunded because the application is withdrawn, refused or deemed to be withdrawn (see A‑X, 10.2.1).

1.1 Analysis of the application

1.2 Formal deficiencies

1.3 Documents cited or supplied by the applicant1.1 Analysis of the application

The search division first of all studies the application to determine the subject-matter of the claimed invention (see B‑III, 3) and critically analyses the claims in the light of the description and drawings to establish whether they are potentially open to any objection. In particular, it studies the content of the claims, description and drawings in enough detail to identify the problem the invention is intended to solve, the inventive concept leading to its solution, the features essential to the solution, as found in the claims, and the results and effects obtained (see, however, B‑III, 3.5). If, according to the description, technical features not included in the claims are essential to solving the stated problem, these features are included in the search (see F‑IV, 4.3(ii) and T 32/82).1.2 Formal deficiencies

If the search division notices any formal shortcomings which have been overlooked by the Receiving Section, it issues an internal communication bringing them to the attention of the Receiving Section (or of the examining division, where it has requested an additional search), which then takes appropriate action. However, the search division does not redo the Receiving Section's work and does not make any time-consuming enquiries into the formalities. Deficiencies it might notice in an application include:

(i)physical deficiencies (see A‑III, 3.2), including:

(a)no electronic sequence listing (Rule 30(1), OJ EPO 2011, 372, OJ EPO 2013, 542)

(b)incorrect sequence and/or positioning of page numbering and/or failure to use Arabic numerals to number pages (Art. 2(5) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A113)

(c)drawings in the description and/or claims (Art. 2(8) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A113)

(d)erasures and/or alterations in the application documents that cast doubt on the authenticity of their content and/or are not conducive to good reproduction (Art. 2(11) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A113).

Art. 90 Art. 92 Art. 78 Art. 53(a) Rules 30 to 34, 40 to Rule 45, 47 to Rule 50 and Rule 55 to Rule 58 OJ EPO 2022, A113

(ii)prohibited matter, i.e. content which:

(a)is contrary to "ordre public" (see A‑III, 8.1, F‑II, 7.2 and G‑II, 4.1, G-II, 4.1.1 and G-II, 4.1.2) or

(b)amounts to a disparaging statement (see A‑III, 8.2) (as opposed to permissible "fair comment" – see F‑II, 7.3).

Art. 53(a) Rule 48(1)(a) and Rule 48(1)(b)

(iii)non-compliance with the provisions on depositing biological material (see A‑IV, 4), in particular any failure to properly identify the depositary institution and the accession number it assigned to the biological material (Rule 31(1)(c); see G 2/93 and A‑IV, 4.2).

(iv)a failure to correctly identify the application as a divisional application within the meaning of Art. 76(1) (Rule 41(2)(e); see A‑IV, 1.3.2).

(v)text in two different EPO official languages (Art. 14).

Rules 31 to Rule 331.3 Documents cited or supplied by the applicant

Under the utilisation scheme (see Rule 141(1) and B‑XI, 9, as well as OJ EPO 2010, 410), applicants whose application claims a priority are expected to file a copy of the results of any search carried out by the office of first filing (for more details, see A‑III, 6.12).

If the prior-art information found by the office of first filing is made available before the search has been completed, the search division will check the citations and assess whether they are relevant for examination and for defining the search strategy.

The search division will also look at documents cited in the application if they are referred to as the starting point of the invention, as showing the state of the art or as providing alternative solutions to the problem concerned or if the application's content cannot be properly understood without them. But it can disregard them if they clearly relate only to details not directly relevant to the claimed invention.

In the exceptional case that the application cites a document that has not been published or is otherwise unavailable to the search division, and it appears to be so essential to properly understanding the claimed invention that a meaningful search on at least part of it would not be possible without knowing what is in it, the search division will send an invitation under Rule 63 (see B‑VIII, 3) that specifies:

(i)which document is needed

(ii)why it is needed

(iii)what will happen if it is not submitted in time (see below).

The applicant can respond by:

(a) either submitting a copy of the document

(b) or arguing why the document is not needed for a meaningful search and/or indicating a part of the application whose subject-matter can be searched without knowing what is in the document.

If the applicant does not submit a copy of the document ‒ or convince the search division that it is not needed for a meaningful search ‒ within the time limit under Rule 63(1), the search division will issue a partial search report or, where applicable, a declaration replacing the search report under Rule 63 (see B‑VIII, 3.2.1) on the following grounds:

(1) because the document was not available, the claimed invention had to be regarded as insufficiently disclosed within the meaning of Art. 83 and

(2) the invention was so insufficiently disclosed that it was impossible to carry out a meaningful search on at least part of it (see B‑VIII, 3).

If the applicant submits the document after the search report and the search opinion (if applicable ‒ see B‑XI, 7) have been drawn up, the examining division may later carry out an additional search on the originally excluded subject-matter in view of the correction of the deficiency which led to the incomplete search (see C‑IV, 7.3).

However, applicants should bear in mind that information in documents referred to in their application can only be taken into account for sufficiency of disclosure under Art. 83 in the circumstances described in F‑III, 8.

2.3 Carrying out the search; types of documents

2.4 Redefining the searched subject-matter

2.5 Closest prior art and its effects on the search

2.6 End of search2.1 Subject-matter of the search; restrictions

Once the search division has determined the subject-matter of the invention as outlined in B‑IV, 1.1, its first step is to define its approach to the search ‒ in terms of what concepts, classes, keywords, etc. it plans to use ‒ as precisely as possible. Often, one or more of the claims themselves can be used for this, but they may have to be generalised in order to cover all aspects and embodiments of the invention. At this point, the search division should also think about whether there is any non-patentable subject-matter (see B‑VIII, 1 and B-VIII, 2) or any lack of unity of invention (see B‑VII, 1.1). It may also have to restrict the search because claims have to be regarded as abandoned (see B‑III, 3.4), because the application falls so short of the EPC requirements that a meaningful search is impossible (see B‑VIII, 3) or because the application does not comply with Rule 43(2) (see the procedure described in B‑VIII, 4). If the search is restricted, this must be mentioned in the search report or the declaration replacing it under Rule 63. The declaration must indicate the reasons for any restrictions under Rule 63 (see B‑X, 8(iii)). The declaration or the partial search report is then treated as the search report for the purposes of the subsequent proceedings.

Rule 63 Rule 62a2.2 Devising a search strategy

The search division next starts the search process by devising a search strategy, i.e. a plan consisting of a series of search statements reflecting the subject-matter to be searched and determining the parts of the documentation to be consulted. A search strategy will initially be made up of one or more combinations of the basic search means mentioned in B‑III, 2.2. But the search process is interactive and iterative in the sense that the search division will revise its initial search statements depending on how useful it considers the information it has found so far (see B‑III, 1.1 and B‑IV, 2.4 and B-IV, 2.6). When using classification groups, the search division selects not only ones in all directly relevant fields but also ones in neighbouring fields.

If appropriate, the search division will also consult other classification (e.g. FI) or indexing (e.g. F‑terms) schemes. It can also consult colleagues working in a similar technical field or in fields possibly related to the content of the application (see B‑I, 2.1).

If in doubt about the right fields to search, the search division can ask a classification expert.

There are usually various possible search strategies, and the search division, drawing on its experience and knowledge of the available search tools, will use its judgement to select the one most appropriate in the case in hand. The search division prioritises search strategies leading to those parts of the documentation where relevant documents are most likely to be found. It will usually give the main technical field of the application priority, first of all using the basic search means (see B‑III, 2.2) most relevant to the specific examples and preferred embodiments of the claimed invention. It will always consider the results already obtained in deciding whether it needs to widen the search to include other, less relevant parts of the documentation.2.3 Carrying out the search; types of documents

The search division then carries out the search, focusing on documents relevant for novelty and inventive step.

It also notes any documents that may be important for other reasons, such as:

(i)conflicting documents (see B‑VI, 4), i.e.:

(a)published European patent applications under Art. 54(3) (see G‑IV, 5.1 and G-IV, 5.1.1)

(b)published international applications under Art. 54(3) and Art. 153(3) and Art. 153(5) (see G‑IV, 5.2)

(c)published national applications of EPC contracting states under Art. 139(2) (see G‑IV, 6 and H‑III, 4.4)

(d)any document published during the priority interval of the application which may become relevant under Art. 54(2) if the priority date turns out to be invalid.

If the applications listed above were published within the searched application's priority interval, they will be cited in the search report as "P" documents (see B‑X, 9.2.4); if they were published on or after the European or international filing date, they will be cited as "E" documents (see B‑X, 9.2.6).

(ii)documents that cast doubt on the validity of any priority claimed (see B‑VI, 3 and F‑VI, 1.4.1), which are cited in the search report as "L" documents (see B‑X, 9.2.8(a)).

(iii)documents that help to understand the claimed invention better or to understand it correctly, which are cited in the search report as "T" documents (see B‑X, 9.2.5).

(iv)documents illustrating the technological background, which are cited in the search report as "A" documents (see B‑X, 9.2.2).

(v)European patent applications that have the same filing or priority date as the searched application, were filed by the same applicant and relate to the same invention and that are therefore relevant to the issue of double patenting (see G‑IV, 5.4), which are cited in the search report as "L" documents (see B‑X, 9.2.8 (c)).

(vi)documents indicating or establishing the publication date of a document found on the internet (see G‑IV, 7.5), which are cited in the search report as "L" documents (see B‑X, 9.2.8 (b)).

(vii)documents found on the internet which do not have any publication date but which the search division nonetheless wants to cite to inform the applicant or third parties (see G‑IV, 7.5.4), which are also cited in the search report as "L" documents (see B‑X, 9.2.8).

However, the search division does not spend a lot of time searching for these documents or considering any related matters unless it has a special reason for doing so in a particular case (see B‑VI, 5.3 and B‑XI, 4).2.4 Redefining the searched subject-matter

Throughout its search, the search division continuously evaluates the results obtained so far and, based on the outcome, uses its judgement to decide whether to redefine the searched subject-matter. For example, the results may show that it needs to change the classification units selected for search or the order of searching them. They may also show that it needs to approach the search documentation in a different way, e.g. by consulting:

(i)documents cited in relevant documents found during the search, for example cited in the description or search report of a patent document, or

(ii)documents citing a relevant document found during the search

or that it needs to turn to documentation not available to it in-house (see B‑IX). When searching external document collections for material relating to unpublished subject-matter using non-secure connections, e.g. on the internet, the search division must choose its search strategies extremely carefully to ensure it does not unwittingly reveal confidential material – i.e. any part of the unpublished patent application (see B‑III, 2.4).2.5 Closest prior art and its effects on the search

Sometimes the search division does not find any documents published before the earliest priority date which prejudice the novelty or the inventive step of the claimed invention. Wherever possible, it will then cite in the search report at least that prior art found which discloses a solution to the same subjective problem as the one dealt with by the claimed invention and whose known solution comes technically closest to the claimed solution. This prior art is cited as an "A" document in the search report (see B‑X, 9.2.2).

If it cannot find such a document, the search division will instead cite as the closest prior art a document which discloses a solution to a problem closely related to the one dealt with by the claimed invention and whose solution is technically the most similar to the one in the searched application.

The search division proceeds in the same way where it finds documents which are accidentally prejudicial to the novelty of the claimed invention (cited as "X" documents) but which do not affect inventive step once the application has been amended appropriately, and does not retrieve any other documents prejudicing inventive step.

Where a European application is derived from an international application and undergoes a supplementary European search after entering the European phase (Art. 153(7) – see B‑II, 4.3), the search division sometimes does not uncover any relevant prior-art documents other than the ones already cited by the ISA in its international search report. When this happens, it is permissible for its supplementary European search report not to cite any additional relevant documents (see B‑X, 9.1.4).2.6 End of search

Efficiency dictates that the search division use its judgement to end its search once the probability of discovering any more relevant prior art becomes very low in comparison to the work involved. It can also stop its search once it has found documents which clearly demonstrate that the entire subject-matter of the claimed invention and its embodiments in the description lack novelty, except for features which are trivial or common general knowledge in the relevant field and whose application would not involve any inventive step. As to the search for conflicting applications, see B‑VI, 4.3. Procedure after searching

3.1 Drawing up the search report

3.2 Documents discovered after completion of the search

3.3 Errors in the search report3.1 Drawing up the search report

Once it has ended its search, the search division selects the documents to be cited in the search report from among those it has found. These always include the most relevant ones (which will be specially labelled in the report, see B‑X, 9.2.1). Less relevant documents are only cited when they concern aspects or details of the claimed invention not found in the documents already selected for citation. If there is some doubt about novelty or inventive step, the search division will cite rather more readily to enable the examining division to consider the matter more fully (see B‑III, 1.1).

The search division does not cite more documents than necessary in the search report and so, if there are several equally relevant documents, it normally cites only one of them. The search report is anyway accompanied by an automatically generated annex listing the available patent documents belonging to the same patent family. When selecting which of these documents to cite, the search division should think about what language is the most convenient, and should preferably cite (or at least note) documents in the same language as the application (see B‑X, 9.1.2).3.2 Documents discovered after completion of the search

The search division occasionally discovers other relevant documents after completing the search report (e.g. in a later search for a related application). These documents can be used in examination (see C‑IV, 7.5).3.3 Errors in the search report

If an editorial error is found in a search report before it has been published, a new search report will be drawn up to replace it. Where the search report has already been sent to the applicant in accordance with Rule 65 but has not yet been published, the applicant is notified of the error immediately. If a serious error is discovered after publication, a corrigendum is published in the European Patent Bulletin, and the applicant and the examining division are informed accordingly. If a different document from the one cited has been made available to the applicant by mistake, the right one is made available.Chapter V – Preclassification, IPC and CPC classification of European patent applications

1. Definitions

2. Preclassification (for file routing and allocation)

3. IPC classification of the application

4. CPC classification of the application1. Definitions

"Preclassification" is a first stage of classification using appropriate classification symbols to broadly identify the subject-matter of the claimed invention (or the invention first claimed if there is more than one) for the purposes of internal application (file) routing and allocation.

"IPC classification" involves assigning the appropriate classification symbols under the International Patent Classification (IPC) scheme published by WIPO. See the WIPO website for the IPC edition currently in force, and the "Guide to the IPC", which explains the principles and rules of IPC classification.

"CPC classification" involves assigning the appropriate classification symbols under the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) scheme published by the EPO and the USPTO. See the CPC website for the CPC edition currently in force, and the "Guide to the CPC", which complements the "Guide to the IPC" in that it deals with the differences between the CPC and the IPC.2. Preclassification (for file routing and allocation)

Applications have to be preclassified to ensure they are allocated to the right search division. The preclassification is assigned using IPC and/or CPC symbols and entered on the electronic file. Based on a cursory read of the application, this initial level of classification is kept as general as possible but should still be specific enough to avoid the need for any further preclassification of the file before it can be properly allocated. In the rare case that this is necessary, arrangements should be made for the file to be redistributed as quickly as possible.

2.1 Incorrect preclassification2.1 Incorrect preclassification

If the search division finds that an application has been incorrectly preclassified and so wrongly allocated to it, it will reallocate it to the right search division by making the appropriate changes on the electronic file. This is normally agreed beforehand with the other search division, but there is sometimes disagreement or uncertainty over classification boundaries, or the search division to which the application was initially allocated may be unsure how to preclassify it correctly. In such cases, it does not spend time trying to resolve the matter but instead forwards the file to a classification specialist.3. IPC classification of the application

The IPC classification of a patent application is assigned by the search division.

The IPC classification identifies all features relevant to the technical subject-matter of the claimed invention (or of each of the claimed inventions if there is more than one) as precisely and comprehensively as possible under the IPC scheme.

The IPC classification consists of "invention information" symbols and "additional information" symbols (the latter include IPC indexing codes) which are assigned according to the IPC rules set out in the "Guide to the IPC". If more than one symbol has to be assigned for the invention itself, the symbol which, in the search division's opinion, best identifies it ‒ or, if that is not straightforward, the one identifying it for which most information is given ‒ is indicated first. The IPC classification should preferably be assigned after the search division has studied the content of the application to decide how to carry out the search. However, if the application is due to be published before the search report is drawn up, it will have to study it in enough detail to decide on the IPC classification at this earlier stage (see B‑X, 5).

The IPC classification relates to what is disclosed in the published application, i.e. the application as filed, and so is determined without taking into consideration what the application could potentially contain if it is later amended. If, however, the search division's understanding of the invention, or of the content of the application as filed, changes significantly during the search (e.g. as a result of prior art found or because obscure points have been clarified) and the preparations for publication have not yet been completed, it will amend the classification accordingly.

3.1 IPC classification of late-published search reports

3.2 IPC classification where the scope of the invention is unclear (e.g. a partial search)

3.3 IPC classification in cases of lack of unity of invention

3.4 Verification of the IPC classification3.1 IPC classification of late-published search reports

Where the search report is published separately from the application because it was not available in time and the search division finds it necessary to amend the assigned IPC classification for the reasons given in B‑V, 3, last paragraph, it will specify the new IPC classification on the search report and point out that it replaces the one on the published application (which then becomes merely the "classification for publication"). It will only change the IPC classification if it is quite certain that it is necessary.

Where a European patent application is classified and published without the European search report (A2 publication), the European search report is drawn up and published separately at a later stage (A3 publication). It can happen that a new edition of the IPC is published in the meantime. The search division will then use the IPC edition which was in force when the application was published for the search report.3.2 IPC classification where the scope of the invention is unclear (e.g. a partial search)

Where the scope of the invention is unclear, the IPC classification has to be based on what appears to be the invention in so far as this can be understood. It will then have to be amended if the search clears up the obscure points (see B‑V, 3, last paragraph).3.3 IPC classification in cases of lack of unity of invention

If the search division finds that the application lacks unity of invention, each of the different inventions claimed must be classified as set out in B‑V, 3 to 3.2 because they will all be disclosed in the published application.3.4 Verification of the IPC classification

As a general rule, applications are not systematically scrutinised after leaving the search division to verify whether it assigned the correct IPC classification. However, the EPO may carry out any spot-checks it considers necessary to ensure that the IPC is applied correctly and uniformly. It is for line managers to decide, based on the search division members' level of experience, whether such checks are needed and, if so, to arrange for them to be carried out before the applications leave their units.4. CPC classification of the application

Besides assigning an IPC classification, the search division also classifies a patent application under the CPC. In practice, the CPC classification is assigned first, and the relevant IPC symbols are then generated from the CPC ones by one-to-one concordance (see the CPC to IPC Concordance List, published on the CPC website).

The CPC classification should be as precise and comprehensive as possible under this classification scheme. The CPC comprises "invention information" symbols and "additional information" symbols. Additional information symbols include CPC indexing codes. If more than one CPC classification symbol has to be assigned for the invention itself, the symbol which, in the search division's opinion, best identifies it ‒ or, if that is not straightforward, the one identifying it for which most information is given ‒ is indicated first.

Like the IPC classification, the CPC classification should preferably be assigned after the search division has studied the content of the application to decide how to carry out the search.

Again like the IPC classification, the CPC classification relates to what is disclosed in the published application, i.e. the application as filed, and so is determined without taking into consideration what the application could potentially contain if it is later amended.

However, if the search division's understanding of the invention, or of the content of the application as filed, changes significantly during the search, it will change the CPC classification accordingly, using the appropriate classification tools. Unlike a change to the IPC classification (see B‑V, 3 above), this change can be made even after the preparations for publication have been completed.

If the scope of the invention is unclear (e.g. a partial search is necessary) or if there is a lack of unity of invention, the principles described in B‑V, 3.2 and 3.3 for the IPC classification apply equally to the CPC classification.Chapter VI – The state of the art at the search stage

1. General

2. Oral disclosure, use, exhibition, etc. as state of the art

3. Priority

4. Conflicting applications

5. Relevant date for documents cited in the search report; filing and priority date

6. Contents of prior-art disclosures

7. Internet disclosures ‒ technical journals1. General

General considerations applying to the state of the art and patentability, especially in the context of assessing novelty and inventive step, are set out in G‑IV.2. Oral disclosure, use, exhibition, etc. as state of the art

Under Art. 54 EPC, a public oral description, use, exhibition, etc. is also considered to be prior art. The search division cites such an oral disclosure as prior art only if it is convinced that the facts can be proved, for example if a document confirming the oral disclosure is available. Written confirmation can be accepted as proof even if it was published after the filing date of the searched application as it is the date of the oral disclosure which is decisive under Art. 54(2). The search division then gives the date of the non-written disclosure as the relevant date (see G‑VI, 3) but must also indicate the date of the subsequent written disclosure.

However, such instances of oral disclosure, prior public use, disclosure by sale, etc. are more usually brought up by opponents in opposition proceedings (see G‑IV, 7.1 to G-IV, 7.4).

Rule 61(4)3. Priority

If the claimed priority dates cannot be verified at the search stage and it is therefore uncertain whether they are valid, the search for conflicting applications will be widened to cover all published applications with an earliest claimed priority date up to the searched application's filing date (not its claimed priority date or dates) (see B‑IV, 2.3 and B‑XI, 4).4. Conflicting applications

4.1 Potentially conflicting European and international applications

4.2 National prior rights4.1 Potentially conflicting European and international applications

Where the search is carried out less than 18 months after the application's European or international filing date (i.e. its filing date under Art. 80 and not its claimed priority date or dates), it will generally not have been possible to search for all potentially conflicting European and international applications, and so the examining division will have to complete this search at the examination stage (see C‑IV, 7.1). However, if the search division does find any potentially conflicting published documents, it will cite them in the search report.

Patent documents, regardless of their state or region of origin, which have a filing date or valid priority date before the filing date of the searched application (not its priority date) but were published on or after that filing date and which contain novelty-destroying subject-matter for at least one independent claim of the application are referred to as "E" documents (see B‑X, 9.2.6).

"E" documents cited in a European search report can be other European or international (WO) patent applications with an earlier priority date (Art. 54(3)) which are relevant because they anticipate the novelty of the subject-matter claimed in the searched application.

An "E" document is novelty-destroying prior art under Art. 54(3) no matter where it discloses the subject-matter in question, i.e. whether it is in the claims, description or drawings.

Art. 54(3)

4.1.1 Published European patent applications as "E" documents

4.1.2 Published international applications (WO) as "E" documents4.1.1 Published European patent applications as "E" documents

(a)European patent applications filed between 1 July 1997 and 12 December 2007 were published with all EPC contracting states automatically designated (OJ EPO 1997, 160) because the designation fees were not payable until after publication (Art. 79(2) EPC 1973). However, the automatic designations made on publication were retroactively invalidated under Rule 23a EPC 1973 for the purposes of Art. 54(3) and (4) EPC 1973 if the relevant designation fees were not then paid on time.

This means that, when a European patent application is found which is potentially relevant as an "E" document because it contains novelty-destroying subject-matter and claims earlier priority rights, and it was filed after the rule on the designation of states changed (i.e. as from 1 July 1997) but before the entry into force of EPC 2000, it is not immediately apparent from the published document which contracting states were validly designated. Nevertheless, such an application is always cited as an "E" document on the assumption that it has validly designated states in common with the searched application.

(b)Any European patent application filed on or after 13 December 2007 which has an earlier filing date than the searched application and was published on or after that application's filing date is potentially state of the art for the purposes of Art. 54(3), regardless of whether the same states are designated.4.1.2 Published international applications (WO) as "E" documents

(a)According to Art. 158(1) EPC 1973, a conflicting PCT application that validly entered the European phase before 13 December 2007 and was retrieved as an "E" document in the search for a European application will constitute prior art within the meaning of Art. 54(3) and (4) EPC 1973 only if before 13 December 2007:

– the EPO has been designated in the international applicationit designates the EPO,

– where necessary, the applicant supplied to the EPO with a translation of the international application into an official EPO language and

– the applicant paid the EPO's national basic fee (the same as the filing fee) under Rule 107(1)(c) EPC 1973 and the EPO's designation fees under Rule 107(1)(d) EPC 1973.

(b)According to Rule 165, a A conflicting PCT application that entered the European phase on or after 13 December 2007 and was retrieved as an "E" document in the search for a European application will constitute prior art within the meaning of Art. 54(3) only if according to Rule 165 on or after 13 December 2007 (see G‑IV, 5.2):

– the EPO has been designated in the international applicationit designates the EPO,

– where necessary, the applicant has supplied to the EPO with a translation of the international application into an official EPO language according to required under Art. 153(4) and Rule 159(1)(a) and

– the applicant has paid the filing fee under Rule 159(1)(c).

Even if it is not possible to verify any of the above requirements based on the published international (WO) application (in particular because the 31-month time limit for meeting them under Art. 22 PCT and Art. 39 PCT has not yet expired for the international application at the time of the search), the application should still be treated as potentially relevant under Art. 54(3) and so be cited as an "E" document in the search report (see also B‑X, 9.2.6).4.2 National prior rights

National applications may have been filed in one or more of the contracting states designated in the European patent application before its filing or priority date and then published as national applications or patents on or after that date. Although such Such applications do not prevent granting a European patent, but are only a potential ground for revocation in the state or states concerned, and so they may be are important for the applicant (see H‑III, 4.4). and so, if If any are found during the search, they will be mentioned in the search report for information (see B‑X, 9.2.6).

Art. 139(2)5. Relevant date for documents cited in the search report; filing and priority date

5.1 Verification of claimed priority dates

5.2 Intermediate documents

5.3 Doubts about the validity of the priority claim; widening of the search

5.4 Documents published after the filing date

5.5 Non-prejudicial disclosures

5.6 Doubts about the state of the art5.1 Verification of claimed priority dates

Where the validity of a priority claim cannot be verified at the search stage (see B‑XI, 4), the filing date of the European patent application accorded by the Receiving Section must be taken as the relevant date for the search. (However, see B‑VI, 3 on the relevant date for the search for conflicting applications.)

Art. 80 Rule 40 Art. 90(3) Art. 54(2)5.2 Intermediate documents

The search division takes documents published between the priority date and the filing date of the searched application into account and labels them as such in the search report (see B‑X, 9.2.4). For identifying what documents can be considered when an application has more than one priority date, the earliest date applies. When selecting which documents to cite in the search report, the search division refers to these dates and preferably chooses a document published before the priority date. For example, if there are two equally relevant documents, one published before the priority date and the other after that date but before the filing date, the search division will choose the former (see B‑IV, 3.1, second paragraph).5.3 Doubts about the validity of the priority claim; widening of the search

The examining division is responsible for checking whether and to what extent the priority claim is justified. However, if its search uncovers intermediate state of the art (see B‑VI, 5.2) or potential state of the art under Art. 54(3), the search division will, if possible, check the validity of the priority claim (see B‑XI, 4, F‑VI, 1.2 to F‑VI, 1.5 and F‑VI, 2). Similarly, if it finds a document showing that a priority claim might not be justified (e.g. an earlier application or patent belonging to the same applicant and suggesting that the application from which priority is claimed may not be the first application for the invention concerned), it will cite this document in the search report (see B‑X, 9.2.8). However, it will not normally carry out any special search for such documents and will do so only if it has a particular reason, e.g. when the priority application is a "continuation-in-part" of an earlier application from which no priority is claimed (see B‑IV, 2.3 and F‑VI, 2.4.4). Sometimes the fact that the applicant's country of residence is different from the priority application's country of filing can also be an indication that it is not a first filing and so justify widening the search to some extent.

If the search is widened this way, it will cover:

(i)published patent documents filed earlier than the claimed priority date

Example 1 (assuming that the applicant is the same for all applications)

Date Application Subject-matter 01.03.98 GB1 filed A 30.05.98 GB2 filed A 30.05.99 EP1 filed (claiming priority of GB2) A 10.09.99 GB1 published A

During the search for EP1, the search division found published application GB1. GB1 was filed earlier than GB2 and so may prejudice the priority claim of EP1. The search division therefore cites published GB1 in the search report as an "L" document (see B‑X, 9.2.8(a)).

(ii)published patent documents which claim priority from an application filed before the searched application's priority date

Example 2 (assuming that the applicant is the same for all applications)

Date Application Subject-matter 01.03.98 GB1 filed A 30.05.98 GB2 filed A 01.03.99 US1 filed (claiming priority of GB1) A 30.05.99 EP1 filed (claiming priority of GB2) A 15.04.00 US1 published A

The publication US1 was found during the search on EP1. GB1 was filed earlier than GB2 and so may prejudice the priority of EP1. The search division therefore cites US1, which claims priority from GB1, in the search report as an "L" document (see B‑X, 9.2.8(a)).5.4 Documents published after the filing date

The search normally does not cover documents published after the filing date of the application accorded by the Receiving Section.

However, documents published after the filing date can sometimes be relevant, for example written confirmation of an oral disclosure (see B‑VI, 2), a later document setting out the principle or theory behind the invention and so helping to understand it better or a later document showing that the reasoning or the facts behind the invention are incorrect (see B‑X, 9.2.5). The search is not specially widened to include documents of this kind, but the search division may choose to cite any it knows of in the search report.

If priority is validly claimed (see B‑VI, 5.1), the search also does not normally cover documents published after the earliest validly claimed priority date as that date counts under Art. 89 as the application's filing date. However, the search may have to be widened this way to some extent for specific purposes (see B‑VI, 3, B‑VI, 4 and B‑VI, 5.3).5.5 Non-prejudicial disclosures

Disclosures of the invention are disregarded if they happened less than six months before the European patent application was filed (see G 3/98 and G 2/99) and if they were due either to an evident abuse in relation to the applicant or the legal predecessor or due to display at an official, or officially recognised, international exhibition. Nevertheless, the search division does cite in the search report any documents it has reason to believe fall within one of the categories mentioned in B‑X, 9.2.8. For these documents too, the relevant date for the search will be the filing date of the application (see B‑VI, 5.1 and B‑XI, 4). Since abuse will generally only be asserted after the search report and search opinion (if applicable ‒ see B‑XI, 7) have been sent, and disclosure at an exhibition involves the question whether the displayed invention and the claimed invention are identical, both matters will be investigated by the examining division.

Art. 55(1)(a) and (b) Rule 255.6 Doubts about the state of the art

It is the examining division, not the search division, that ultimately decides on novelty (see B‑III, 1.1), and so the search division does not disregard highly relevant documents because it has doubts about, for instance, when exactly they were published or made publicly available (e.g. standards or related preparatory documents, see G‑IV, 7.6) or, where they refer to an oral disclosure, exhibition, etc., what exactly was said or displayed. It tries to remove any such doubts but always cites the documents in the search report anyway, while continuing its search as though they had not been found. It can also cite additional documents providing evidence on the matters in doubt (see B‑X, 9.2.8). It will explain any such matters in detail in the search opinion.

Any date of publication indicated in a document is accepted as correct unless there is good reason to challenge it, e.g. where the search division can show it was published earlier or where the applicant can show in examination proceedings that it was published later. If the indicated date of publication is not precise enough (e.g. because only a month or year is given) to establish whether it was published before the relevant date for the search, the search division will try to determine the exact date or at least narrow it down with enough precision to establish this. A date of receipt at the EPO stamped on the document or a reference in another document, which must then be cited (see B‑X, 9.2.8), can help with this. Whether a document was publicly available may be investigated when the search opinion is drawn up and during substantive examination (see C‑IV, 1). Where, despite the search division's attempts, the date is still not precise enough for it to know whether or not the document was published before or after the priority or filing date, it will cite it as though it had been published on the earliest possible date. For instance, if only the month and year of publication are known, the search division will cite it as having been published on the first day of that month.6. Contents of prior-art disclosures

6.1 General remark

6.2 Citation of documents corresponding to documents not available or not published in one of the EPO's official languages

6.3 Conflict between abstract and source document

6.4 Insufficient prior-art disclosures

6.5 Incorrect compound records in online databases6.1 General remark

As a general rule, the search division cites only documents which are available in the search documentation or which it can access in some other way.6.2 Citation of documents corresponding to documents not available or not published in one of the EPO's official languages

In certain circumstances, the search division can cite a document without having verified its content if it has good reason to assume that it is identical in content to another document which it has inspected. Both documents are then mentioned in the search report as described at the end of B‑X, 9.1.2. For example, where a document published in a non‑EPO language before the filing date has been selected for citation, the search division may instead have inspected a corresponding document in an official EPO language (e.g. another member of the same patent family or a translation of an article) and possibly published after the filing date. Unless the contrary is explicitly stated, it can also be assumed that an abstract's contents are included in the original document, just as it is normally assumed that what is said in a report of an oral presentation matches what was presented.

Before citing a document written in a language it is not familiar with, the search division must make sure it is relevant (e.g. by using a machine translation, a translation by a colleague, a corresponding document or an abstract in a familiar language, by referring to a drawing or chemical formula in the document to be cited or by consulting database indexes relating to that document's technical content (see B‑X, 9.1.3)).6.3 Conflict between abstract and source document

Where there is a problem with an abstract, either because it appears to conflict with its source document or because it conflicts with other abstracts of the same source document, the search division will proceed as follows:

(i)it will cite the source document if it is in a language it can readily understand (especially one of an EPC contracting state) and either directly available to it or easy to obtain.

(ii)it will cite the abstract if the source document is in a language it cannot readily understand (e.g. Russian, Japanese, Korean or Chinese) and/or is difficult to obtain. If more than one abstract is available, it will cite the one most relevant to the claimed invention even if it conflicts with the other abstracts or the source document.

The source document will be mentioned in the search report as the "&" document of the cited abstract. Where it is available but is in a language the search division cannot readily understand (e.g. Japanese), both it and the abstract will be made available to the applicant and included in the file (see B‑X, 9.1.2). The search division must explain in the search opinion why it thinks there is a conflict.

Where an abstract conflicts with the source document to such an extent that it is incorrect, it is not treated as prior art, and the source document is considered to be the state of the art instead (T 77/87). However, for the purposes of the search report and opinion, an abstract is assumed to truly reflect the source document's content unless the discrepancy between the two is obvious. Since the abstract, the source document and a machine translation of the source document are all made available (see B‑X, 9.1.3 and B-X, 12), the applicant can compare their disclosures and form an opinion on whether the abstract is technically accurate. They will still have an opportunity to refute the above assumption at the examination stage (e.g. by providing a translation of the source document).6.4 Insufficient prior-art disclosures

The search division generally assumes that any technical subject-matter in a prior-art document is sufficiently disclosed and so part of the state of the art. Even if there is some doubt about this, it will still be cited in the search report as normal and relied on as a basis for an objection in the search opinion. It will be disregarded only if its disclosure is obviously insufficient (see G‑IV, 2).6.5 Incorrect compound records in online databases

If the search division finds a compound when searching a database created by abstracting source documents (e.g. patents, journal articles or books) and identifying the chemical compounds disclosed in them but, on reading the source document, cannot find the compound, this does not automatically mean that there has been a mistake and that the compound is not disclosed in the document. For example, compounds which are named but whose structures are not drawn are still part of the disclosure and will be abstracted. In addition, database providers use standard nomenclature in their database records, whereas authors of technical literature frequently do not, and so the database record may use a different nomenclature for the compound from the source document.

However, if the search division really is unable to find the compound in the source document, but the compound is relevant for assessing patentability, it may write to the database provider to ask why the compound was included in the abstract and where it is disclosed in the source. If the database provider has not replied by the time the search report is drafted, the document will be cited in the search report and in the search opinion on the assumption that it does disclose the compound, but the search division will also continue the search as though the compound did not exist.7. Internet disclosures ‒ technical journals

For some technical journals, the publisher's website displays the date when they were published online, especially if it differs from the date when they were published on paper (OJ EPO 2009, 456). There are various possible scenarios where a journal was published online (see G‑IV, 7.5.3.1). In all cases, the search division makes a copy of the journal web page where the (electronic and paper) publication and pre-publication date or dates of the article or issue are mentioned and then cites it in the search report as an "L" document. It is best to do so as soon as the evidence is found and not leave it until later, since the information may be moved or removed from the website in the time between search and substantive examination.Chapter VII – Unity of invention

1. General remarks

2. Procedures in cases of lack of unity

3. Lack of unity and Rule 62a or Rule 631. General remarks

The requirement of unity of invention has a regulatory function and is intended to promote an efficient procedure up to grant (T 110/82 and F‑V, 6). It would be unfair to treat applications as meeting this requirement where, because of their diverse content, they cost much more than average to process, especially in terms of search, since some of this extra cost would have to be covered by fees paid for other applications. Another aspect is that an application's content should be readily understandable, which will not always be the case where its subject-matter is very diverse.

On the other hand, the general purpose of dealing with linked substantive issues in a single procedure would not be achieved if the provisions on unity of invention were applied too strictly, and so interconnected subject-matter must not be split up needlessly (see F‑V).

1.1 Partial European search report

1.2 Invitation to pay further search fees

1.3 Documents relevant only to other inventions

1.4 Assessment and possible review of the unity requirement1.1 Partial European search report

If the search division considers that a European patent application lacks unity of invention (see F‑V, 1), it must carry out a search, and draw up a partial European search report under Rule 64(1), for those parts which relate to the invention (or unitary group of inventions) first mentioned in the claims (see F‑V, 3.4). The partial European search report is accompanied by a list of the separate inventions identified.

For more on the search opinion in cases where there is a lack of unity of invention, see B‑XI, 5.

Rule 641.2 Invitation to pay further search fees

The search division will inform the applicant of the lack of unity of invention in a communication accompanying its partial search report and invite them to pay a further search fee for each invention other than the one first mentioned in the claims if they want the search to cover these inventions as well. Together with this invitation, the applicant will receive a provisional opinion on the patentability of the invention or unitary group of inventions first mentioned in the claims (see F‑V, 3.4) and the reasons for the non-unity findings. This provisional opinion is for information only and the applicant does not need to reply to the points raised in it. If the applicant nevertheless submits a reply, the search division will not take it into account when drawing up the extended European search report (see the notice from the EPO dated 3 March 2017, OJ EPO 2017, A20).

Rule 64(1) Point 6.1 AAD

1.2.1 General

1.2.2 Cascading non-unity

1.2.3 The applicant has not paid all further search fees1.2.1 General

The further search fees must be paid within two months (Rule 64(1)). Applicants using the automatic debiting procedure must inform the EPO within this period if they do not want some or even any of the other inventions to be searched, because otherwise further search fees for all of them will be debited automatically on the last day.

(a)If the applicant does not pay any further search fees in time, there will be no further search and the partial search report will become the final search report, which is accompanied by the search opinion. Nevertheless, the final decision on unity of invention is taken by the examining division or – in the event of an appeal – ultimately by the board of appeal (B‑VII, 1.4 and C‑III, 3.2.1).

(b)If the applicant pays further search fees for any of the remaining inventions or groups of inventions in time, a further search will be carried out on those inventions. The final search report will then be drawn up for all inventions for which search fees have been paid, i.e. the first one and the ones included in the further search. If the application does not meet the EPC requirements as regards any of the inventions for which further search fees have been paid, this will be mentioned in the search opinion. For example: invention 1 was searched and the applicant paid a further search fee for invention 3. The subject-matter of invention 3 was found to lack novelty. The search opinion will then cover invention 1 and object to a lack of novelty for the subject-matter of invention 3.1.2.2 Cascading non-unity

If a European patent application is found to lack unity at the search stage, the invention first mentioned in the claims (see F‑V, 3.4) will be searched and the applicant will be invited to pay further search fees for the others. They will also be warned that, even if a lack of unity "a posteriori" is later detected, no further invitation to pay additional fees will be issued.

If the applicant pays further search fees for any of the other inventions, a search is carried out for those inventions.

If this further search reveals that one or more of these inventions also lack unity "a posteriori", only the first invention in each group of inventions is searched. The applicant will not be invited to pay another set of further search fees.

The search division will draw up the search opinion, setting out the reasons for its finding of non-unity and giving an opinion on the patentability of the searched inventions (see B‑XI, 5).

Divisional applications can be filed for any inventions that have not been searched (see C‑IX, 1.2).

Example

The search division raises a lack of unity objection and identifies four different inventions A, B, C, D. The first invention A is searched and the applicant is invited to pay further search fees for inventions B, C and D. The warning mentioned above is given.

The applicant pays two further search fees for inventions B and C. During the further search, B is found to lack unity "a posteriori" and is divided into groups of inventions B1, B2 and B3.

In this case only B1 and C are searched. The European search opinion must fully explain why the claims of the application were divided into A, B, C and D and why B was then subdivided into B1, B2 and B3 and offer a view on whether A, B1 and C are patentable.

Examination of the application in the European phase will be based on either A, B1 or C (see C‑III, 3.2.2). The claims relating to inventions B2, B3 and D can be filed as divisional applications (see C‑IX, 1.2).1.2.3 The applicant has not paid all further search fees

The applicant always has to clearly state which inventions the further search fees have been paid for. If the applicant pays only some, but not all, of the requested further search fees and does not indicate which inventions these fees are for, the search division will attempt to find out which inventions are to be covered by its further search or searches.1.3 Documents relevant only to other inventions

The search on the invention first mentioned in the claims may also uncover documents that are relevant only to the other inventions. These documents do not necessarily have to be included in the partial European search report unless they are the basis for an objection to lack of unity "a posteriori" (see F‑V, 5 and F-V, 7).1.4 Assessment and possible review of the unity requirement

A search division dealing with unity at the search stage applies the same criteria as are used in substantive examination (see F‑V). In particular, it will not raise an objection of lack of unity merely because the inventions claimed are classed in separate classification groups, or simply as a way of restricting the search to certain parts of the documentation, for example certain classification groups (but see B‑V, 3.3).

The assessment of unity at the search stage is not definitive. Normally, the search division will have formed a first impression even before it carries out the search, but it will necessarily have done so prima facie, based on the common general knowledge in the relevant field and the prior art mentioned in the application. It will revisit this initial assessment during and after the search in the light of the documents found. Its findings will be reviewed again when substantive examination begins and even the position taken then may be changed later on in the proceedings in the light of new facts and evidence.

However, as a general rule, a position already taken on unity of invention is maintained unless there are sound reasons for changing it. The final decision on the matter is taken by the examining division or – in the event of an appeal – ultimately by the board of appeal. So any previous finding on unity is basically always open to review.2. Procedures in cases of lack of unity

2.1 Request for refund of further search fees

2.2 Complete search despite lack of unity

2.3 Supplementary European search2.1 Request for refund of further search fees

At the examination stage, the applicant may challenge the finding of non-unity and request a refund of one or more of the further search fees paid. If the examining division finds that the challenge is justified, the fee or fees in question will be refunded (see, however, B‑XI, 1.2).

Rule 64(2) Rule 164(5)2.2 Complete search despite lack of unity

In some exceptional cases ‒ especially where the lack of unity was not immediately apparent and is detected "a posteriori" and the different inventions identified are conceptually very close ‒ the extra work and cost involved in carrying out a complete search and drawing up a search opinion (where applicable – see B‑XI, 7) for all the inventions is only negligible. In such cases, the search division carries out the search on the other inventions at the same time as the one on the invention first mentioned in the claims and includes all the results in a single search report, in which it objects to the lack of unity and identifies the different inventions. It will also point out that it did not invite the applicant to pay further search fees because it was able to search all the claims without the extra work that would justify them. However, the search opinion (if applicable ‒ see B‑XI, 7) will still raise the objection to the lack of unity of invention (see B‑XI, 5).2.3 Supplementary European search

If a lack of unity of invention comes to light during a supplementary European search following an international (PCT) search, a partial supplementary European search report is drawn up on the invention or group of inventions first mentioned in the claims (see F‑V, 3.4) on which the supplementary European search was based (Rule 164(1)(a)), irrespective of the ISA's findings on unity of invention. Together with this partial search report, the applicant will be invited to pay a further search fee for each invention other than the one first mentioned in the claims (Rule 164(1)(b)), i.e. the same procedure is followed as for the non-unity invitation issued under Rule 64(1) for direct European patent applications (see B‑VII, 1.2). The applicant will also receive a provisional opinion on the patentability of the invention or unitary group of inventions first mentioned in the claims, which will include the reasons for the non-unity findings.

Art. 153(7) Rule 164(1)3. Lack of unity and Rule 62a or Rule 63

The procedures for dealing with cases of lack of unity in which Rule 63 or Rule 62a applies are dealt with in B‑VIII, 3.4 and B-VIII, 4.5 respectively.Chapter VIII – Subject-matter to be excluded from the search

1. General remarks

2. Considerations relating to specific exclusions from and exceptions to patentability

3. No meaningful search possible

4. More than one independent claim per category (Rule 62a)

5. Invitation under both Rule 62a(1) and Rule 63(1)

6. Claims contravening Art. 123(2) or Art. 76(1)1. General remarks

The subject-matter listed in Rule 39.1 PCT can be regarded as excluded from the scope of a European search under the EPC too, i.e. on the basis that it is not susceptible of industrial application (Art. 57), is excluded from patentability under Art. 52(2) and Art. 52(3) in so far as the European patent application relates to it as such or falls under one of the exceptions to patentability in Art. 53(b) and Art. 53(c). The claims are not searched in so far as they relate to such subject-matter (for the procedure for limiting the search under Rule 63, see B‑VIII, 3.1 to B-VIII, 3.4). For the specific case of compositions for use in methods of treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, or diagnostic methods practised on the human or animal body, see B‑VIII, 2.1 below.

Art. 52(2) and Art. 52(3) Art. 53 Art. 57 Rule 63

The examining division is responsible for taking a final decision on whether the subject-matter is patentable, but the search division will also form a view on this for the purpose of drafting the search opinion (if applicable ‒ see B‑XI, 7) and also in considering whether or not it needs to limit the search and apply the procedure under Rule 63(1) (see B‑VIII, 3.1 to B-VIII, 3.4). This means that it too has to consider the patentability requirements other than novelty and inventive step (see G‑II and G‑III).

Art. 52

It may be that potentially non-patentable subject-matter is found in only some of the claims or only part of a claim. This will then be indicated in the invitation under Rule 63(1) and in any subsequent partial search report or declaration replacing the search report under Rule 63(2).

Rule 632. Considerations relating to specific exclusions from and exceptions to patentability

2.1 Methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practised on the human or animal body

2.2 Subject-matter excluded from patentability under Art. 52(2) and (3)2.1 Methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practised on the human or animal body

Even where a claim is drafted as a method of medical treatment (see G‑II, 4.2) and is therefore not directed to patentable subject-matter, a meaningful search may be possible if the determinant technical feature is the effect of the substance, which can be searched. The procedure under Rule 63 (see B‑VIII, 3.1 to B-VIII, 3.4) will then be unnecessary. For example, method claims can be worded as follows:

"A method of treating dementia by administering a compound of formula X to a patient"

or

"A method of diagnosis of disease Y practised on the human/animal body, comprising steps A, B and C"

These method claims are excluded from patentability under Art. 53(c), but the applicant will usually be able to reword them in an allowable form during the examination proceedings (see G‑II, 4.2). They are therefore searched since they are usually characterised by the effect of substance X, by one or more of steps A, B and C not directly practised on the human or animal body or by the use of reagents rather than by the act of therapy or diagnosis on the human/animal body.

If, however, a claim includes specific method features (e.g. a combination of pharmaceutical and physical treatment), a meaningful search may not be possible. If in doubt, the search division will issue an invitation under Rule 63(1) (see B‑VIII, 3.1). But, regardless of whether such claims are searched or not, the applicant will be informed in the search opinion (if applicable ‒ see B‑XI, 7) that the subject-matter in question is excluded from patentability (see B‑XI, 3).2.2 Subject-matter excluded from patentability under Art. 52(2) and (3)

Subject-matter or activities listed in Art. 52(2), when taken as such (Art. 52(3)), are considered non-technical (G‑II, 1 and 2). If a claim contains a mix of technical and non-technical features, the search division identifies which features contribute to the technical character of the claimed subject-matter (see G‑VII, 5.4) and its search covers all those features.

Features that appear to be non-technical when taken in isolation may still contribute to the technical character of a claimed invention if, in the context of that invention, they help to produce a technical effect that has a technical purpose. Merely implementing effects that are inherent in the excluded subject-matter (T 1543/06) or that result from circumventing the technical problem rather than contributing to its technical solution does not qualify as a technical effect (T 258/03). Examples of how to evaluate contribution to technical character for each of the items listed in Art. 52(2) are provided in G‑II, 3.1-G-II, 3.7.

Claimed features are analysed in the light of the description and drawings to determine whether they produce a technical effect and contribute to a technical solution to a technical problem (see B‑III, 3.2 and B‑IV, 1.1). In particular, specific embodiments disclosed in the description and drawings ‒ to which the claims might reasonably be expected to be limited (see B‑III, 3.5) ‒ are taken into account since they could confer technical character on the claimed features.

If the search division considers that some claim features do not contribute to the technical character of the claimed invention, it will state this in the search opinion. If it objects to a lack of inventive step and at least some of the distinguishing features are found not to have a technical effect contributing to the solution of a technical problem (see G‑VII, 5.4), it will substantiate this finding.

If the features contributing to the technical character of the subject-matter of claims directed to computer-implemented business methods are so well-known that their existence at the relevant date cannot reasonably be disputed (T 1411/08, Reasons 4.1 and 4.2, and T 690/06, Reasons 13), the search division does not have to cite any documentary evidence of the relevant state of the art in the search report, because they then amount to "notorious" knowledge, for which no such evidence is needed. "Notorious knowledge" is not to be confused with the skilled person's common general knowledge, which is something that generally can be reasonably challenged (G‑VII, 2 and 3.1). In such exceptional cases, a search report with no cited documents may be issued under Rule 61 (OJ EPO 2007, 592). This is not the same thing as issuing a declaration of no search or a partial search report under Rule 63(2).3. No meaningful search possible

In addition to the reasons discussed in B‑VIII, 1, an invitation under Rule 63(1) may be issued and the search subsequently limited under Rule 63(2) because the application falls so short of the relevant EPC requirements that it is impossible to carry out a meaningful search on all or some of the claims or part of a claim. The search division then applies the procedure under Rule 63 (see B‑VIII, 3.1 to B-VIII, 3.4 and OJ EPO 2009, 533).

Rule 63 relates only to whether the search is practicable and not to whether its results are likely to be relevant in the later examination proceedings. Even if a search will not produce any result that could be used in examination proceedings, it cannot be refused on the basis of Rule 63 (see T 1242/04).

What is or is not "meaningful" is a question of fact to be answered by the search division. Its finding may change in the light of any reply from the applicant to the invitation under Rule 63(1) (see B‑VIII, 3.2). How the search division exercises its discretion will depend on the facts of the case. A restriction of the search must be carefully considered. There are cases where a search is impossible in practice in view of the failure to meet the EPC requirements, for example a fundamental lack of clarity or the absence of any technical character whatsoever. However, the word "meaningful" must always be construed reasonably, i.e. Rule 63 cannot be invoked simply because a search is difficult or does not produce results relevant for subsequent examination proceedings.

As there is no legal provision requiring that applicants draft their application in a way that makes searching easier, "procedural economy" cannot be used as a reason, or part of a reason, for issuing a partial search report (see also T 1020/98).

The following – non-exhaustive – examples illustrate where Rule 63 can apply:

(i)claims lacking support; insufficient disclosure

An example is a claim so broadly formulated that its scope is at least to some extent speculative, i.e. not supported by the disclosure of the application. It is then so broad that a meaningful search cannot be carried out over its whole scope but only on the basis of the narrower, disclosed invention. In extreme cases, this may mean a search covering only (one or more of) the specific examples disclosed in the description. The procedure under Rule 63(1) can then be applied (see B‑VIII, 3.1 to B‑VIII, 3.4) on the basis of a failure to meet the requirements of sufficiency of disclosure and support set out in Art. 83 and Art. 84 (see F‑III, 1 and F-III, 2, and F‑IV, 6). However, the search division needs to bear in mind that whether these requirements are met has to be assessed from the point of view of the person skilled in the art.

(ii)claims lacking conciseness

An example is where there are so many claims, or so many possibilities within a claim, that it is unduly burdensome to determine the subject-matter for which protection is sought (however, see B‑VIII, 4 on multiple independent claims in the same category). A complete search (or even any search at all) may then be impossible in practice. Again, it may be appropriate to apply Rule 63 and then issue a partial search report (following the procedures described in B‑VIII, 3.1 to B-VIII, 3.3) or a declaration of no search, on the grounds that the claims are so lacking in conciseness that a meaningful search is impossible (see Art. 84; F‑IV, 5).

(iii)claims lacking clarity

An example is where the parameter chosen by the applicant to define the invention makes a meaningful comparison with the prior art impossible, for example because the prior art did not use the same parameter or did not use any parameter at all. The applicant's parameter may then lack clarity (see Art. 84; F‑IV, 4.11) and it may even be so unclear that a meaningful search of the claims, an individual claim or part of an individual claim is impossible. It may then be appropriate to apply Rule 63 and issue a partial search report (or, in exceptional cases, no search report at all) under Rule 63(2) (following the procedures described in B‑VIII, 3.1 to B-VIII, 3.3) after restricting the search to the worked examples, in so far as they can be understood, or to the way in which the desired parameter is obtained (any reply from the applicant to the invitation under Rule 63(1) would then be taken into account as described in B‑VIII, 3.2 to determine the subject-matter to be searched).

(iv)claims contravening Art. 76 or Art. 123(2)

Rule 63 may also apply in the following cases of claims containing added subject-matter (see B‑VIII, 6):

– claims in divisional applications contravening Art. 76

– applications for which the claims were filed after the filing date and which contravene Art. 123(2) or

– Euro-PCT applications for which amended claims were filed as a basis for the supplementary European search and which contravene Art. 123(2).

These examples are not exhaustive (see also B‑VIII, 6). The basic principle is that it needs to be clear and transparent for both the applicant and third parties what has and has not been searched.

How these Rule 63 cases are handled in subsequent examination proceedings is dealt with in H‑II, 5 and H‑IV, 4.1.1.

3.2 Reply to the invitation under Rule 63(1)

3.3 Content of the extended European search report (EESR)

3.4 Applications falling under Rule 63 and lacking unity3.1 Invitation to indicate subject-matter for search

If the search division considers that the application falls so short of the EPC requirements that it cannot carry out a meaningful search into the state of the art on the basis of all or some of the subject-matter claimed (see B‑VIII, 1, B-VIII, 2 and B-VIII, 3), it will invite the applicant to file, within two months, a statement indicating the subject-matter to be searched. The invitation will also give the reasons for this finding and may additionally indicate the claimed subject-matter on which the search division considers it feasible to base a meaningful search.

In the particular case of medical method claims, the search division issues a complete search report only when the claims can easily be reworded to comprise patentable subject-matter (see B‑VIII, 2.1). If, on the other hand, it plans to issue a partial search report (or a declaration of no search), it must first send an invitation (e.g. for the claims that cannot easily be reworded).

Rule 63(1), Rule 63(2)3.2 Reply to the invitation under Rule 63(1)

3.2.1 No or late reply

3.2.2 Reply in time3.2.1 No or late reply

If applicants do not reply to the invitation under Rule 63(1) in time, the search division will take its own decision on what to search. It will then draw up a partial search report for what it searched or, in exceptional cases, issue a declaration of no search. As the limitation of the search has consequences in examination (see H‑II, 5 and H‑IV, 4.1.1), any late-filed reply will be included in the file for consideration at that stage because it may be useful for reviewing the search division's arguments for carrying out an incomplete search.

Given that the search report should be published with the application, applicants cannot request further processing if they miss the two-month period under Rule 63, but they can request re-establishment of rights (see OJ EPO 2009, 533).3.2.2 Reply in time

If applicants reply to the invitation under Rule 63(1) in time and the search division considers it possible to carry out a meaningful search based on the subject-matter they have indicated, it will search that subject-matter.

If applicants reply to the invitation under Rule 63(1) in time but the indicated subject-matter still cannot be fully searched, the search division will take its own decision on what to search, but will keep to what was indicated in the applicant's reply as far as possible. In exceptional cases, it may find that no meaningful search is possible at all.

Statements consisting of reworded claims filed in reply to an invitation under Rule 63(1) are not considered amended claims within the meaning of Rule 137(1) but treated merely as explanations of the originally filed claims. The applicant must formally introduce these reworded claims into the proceedings by confirming that this is what they want within the time limit under Rule 70(1) or (2). The confirmation can be filed either together with the reply to the extended European search report (Rules 70a(1) and Rule 70a(2)) or, where applicable, when complying with the requirements under Rule 70(1) or (2). As far as possible, the search division will draw up the search report in the light of these explanations. Both the search report and the search opinion must clearly indicate what has been searched.

Instead of indicating the subject-matter to be searched, applicants can reply to the invitation under Rule 63(1) by simply arguing why they believe a meaningful search can be carried out on all of the subject-matter claimed. If the search division is convinced by the applicant's arguments, it will issue a full search report. The search will therefore not be limited and there will be none of the associated consequences in examination. But if it is not convinced, or is only partially convinced, it will take its own decision on what to search and then issue a partial search report or, in exceptional cases, a declaration of no search. The examining division has final responsibility for deciding whether it was appropriate to send an invitation under Rule 63 and issue a declaration of no search or a partial search report at the search stage and it may find that it has to carry out an additional search (see C‑IV, 7.3).

Applicants can also reply to an invitation under Rule 63 by arguing against the findings there and ‒ as a main request ‒ asking the search division to fully search the claims as filed and ‒ as an alternative, in case the search division is still not convinced ‒ indicating specific subject-matter they would like to have searched (see also H‑III, 3.2).

A consultation may take place if the applicant phones the search division to enquire about the course of action after an invitation under Rule 63 has been sent. The consultation is limited to formal issues concerning the content of the invitation and the options available to the applicant. The search division writes minutes of the consultation and sends them to the applicant (without setting any time limit) for information only. The consultation itself does not count as a valid reply to the invitation and so the applicant still has to file a written reply within the time limit set there.

Rule 63(2)3.3 Content of the extended European search report (EESR)

In the two parts of the EESR, i.e. the search report (or the declaration of no search replacing it) and the search opinion, the search division will explain why it found under Rule 63 that it could not carry out a meaningful search on some or all of the claimed subject-matter and specify what subject-matter it did search (if any) following the procedures described in B‑VIII, 3.2. In the search opinion, it will also invite the applicant to limit the claims to this searched subject-matter (in order to comply with Rule 63(3)). The documents cited in the search report and referred to in the search opinion will relate only to this subject-matter. Even if the searched subject-matter meets the EPC requirements (in particular in that it is novel, inventive and industrially applicable, but also in that it meets the other conditions, such as clarity under Art. 84), the search opinion will still be negative, because the claims do not meet these requirements across their whole scope.

Similarly, if the applicant replies to the invitation under Rule 63(1) by disputing the finding that a meaningful search is impossible (see B‑VIII, 3.2) but the search division still disagrees, it will explain why in the search opinion, referring directly to the applicant's reply if necessary.3.4 Applications falling under Rule 63 and lacking unity

There are cases where the application not only falls so short of the EPC requirements that it is impossible to carry out a meaningful search into the state of the art based on some of the subject-matter claimed (B‑VIII, 1, B-VIII, 2 and B-VIII, 3) but also lacks unity of invention under Art. 82 and Rule 44. Sometimes it is enough for the search division to raise only unity of invention and send an invitation under Rule 64(1) (see B‑VII, 1.1 and B-VII, 1.2), for example where a large number of claims results in a serious lack of conciseness but this can be resolved by splitting the claims up into the different inventions.

In other cases, however, the search division may need to apply the procedures under both Rule 64(1) (i.e. invite the applicant to pay further search fees for inventions other than the one first mentioned in the claims) and Rule 63(1) (i.e. invite the applicant to indicate the subject-matter to be searched). If so, it will send the applicant the Rule 63(1) invitation first. Where the lack of unity is already apparent, this invitation will also identify the invention (or group of inventions) first mentioned in the claims ("first invention" ‒ see F‑V, 3.4) and the claims which relate to it, either in full or in part, and ask the applicant to clarify what to search in this respect.

If the applicant has not replied by expiry of the time limit under Rule 63(1), any subject-matter to be searched for the first invention will be determined according to the procedures described in B‑VIII, 3.2. A partial search report (or exceptionally a declaration of no search) will then be drawn up on this first invention and sent to the applicant, along with an invitation to pay further search fees under Rule 64(1) for the other inventions and a provisional opinion on the first invention's patentability that includes the reasons for the non-unity findings. Where appropriate, the invitation under Rule 64(1) may also include an invitation under Rule 63(1) asking the applicant to clarify the subject-matter to be searched for any other inventions for which they later pay further search fees.

Where these exceptional circumstances arise in cases of supplementary European search reports for Euro-PCT applications, the procedure is the same, except that a Rule 164(1) invitation is sent instead of a Rule 64 invitation.

Rule 164

Rule 63 also applies to searches performed under Rule 164(2) (see C‑III, 3.1). As for searches on directly filed European patent applications, any Rule 63 objection relating to an invention for which a search fee has to be paid must be included in the invitation to pay that fee.

4.4 Cases under Rule 62a where claims fees have not been paid

4.5 Applications falling under Rule 62a and lacking unity

4.6 Handling of dependent claims under Rule 62a4.1 Invitation to indicate which independent claim to search

If the search division considers that the claims as filed do not comply with Rule 43(2) (see F‑IV, 3.2), it may invite the applicant to indicate compliant claims on which the search can be based within two months. In the same way as for an invitation under Rule 64, it is left to the search division's discretion whether to send this invitation or instead carry out a full search on all the claims and raise the objection under Rule 43(2) only in the written opinion.

Rule 62a(1)4.2 Reply to the invitation under Rule 62a(1)

4.2.1 Failure to reply in time

4.2.2 Reply filed in time4.2.1 Failure to reply in time

If the applicant does not indicate the claims to be searched in time, the search will be based on the first claim in each category. In either case, a partial search report will be drawn up. As the limitation of the search has consequences in examination (see H‑II, 5 and H‑IV, 4.1.1), any late-filed reply is included in the file for consideration at that stage, in the same way as is done for a late-filed reply to a Rule 63 invitation (see B‑VIII, 3.2.1).

Since the search report should be available when the application is published, Rule 62a requires that the applicant reply within two months and rules out further processing. However, a request for re-establishment of rights may be granted if the relevant conditions are met.4.2.2 Reply filed in time

If applicants reply to the invitation under Rule 62a(1) in time by indicating an independent claim in a particular category that they want to have searched, the search division will carry out the search based on this claim.

It is also open to applicants to indicate more than one independent claim in the same category if these claims fall within the exceptions in Rule 43(2) (see F‑IV, 3.2). However, if the search division then finds that the indicated independent claims do not in fact fall within these exceptions, it will search only the one that comes first in numerical order.

Example

An invitation under Rule 62a(1) is sent for an application that contains independent product claims 1, 10 and 15. The applicant replies that independent product claims 10 and 15 fall within the exceptions in Rule 43(2) and indicates that these two claims should be searched. The search division disagrees, and so only claim 10 is searched.

See B‑VIII, 3.2.2 for the procedure followed where the applicant tries to file amendments.

Instead of indicating the independent claim or claims to be searched, applicants can reply to the invitation under Rule 62a(1) by simply arguing why they believe that the claims comply with Rule 43(2) (i.e. why the multiple independent claims in the same category fall within one or more of the exceptions in Rule 43(2)). If the search division is convinced by the applicant's arguments, it will issue a search report based on all the claims, and the consequences a limited search has at the examination stage will not apply. But if it is not convinced, it will issue a search report based only on the first independent claim in the category. The examining division has final responsibility for deciding whether an invitation under Rule 62a was appropriate.

Applicants can also reply to an invitation under Rule 62a by arguing against the findings there and ‒ as a main request ‒ asking the search division to search all the claims as filed and ‒ as an alternative, in case the search division is still not convinced ‒ indicating the independent claims they would like to have searched (see also H‑III, 3.2).

The procedure where applicants phone the search division to enquire about the course of action after an invitation under Rule 62a has been sent is as described above for the invitation under Rule 63 (see B‑VIII, 3.2.2).4.3 Content of the extended European search report (EESR)

The search opinion will invite the applicant to limit the application to the claims which have been searched (Rule 62a(2)). If the applicant replied to the invitation under Rule 62a(1) by disputing the finding under Rule 43(2) (see B‑VIII, 4.2) but the search division still disagrees, it will explain why in the search opinion.4.4 Cases under Rule 62a where claims fees have not been paid

If an independent claim has been deemed to be abandoned under Rule 45(3) or Rule 162(4) because the claims fee has not been paid (see A‑III, 9), the applicant cannot indicate it in reply to the invitation under Rule 62a(1), because it is no longer eligible for search (see B‑III, 3.4). If such a claim is indicated, the search division will ignore this, instead applying Rule 62a(1), last sentence, and searching the first independent claim in the category in question for which claims fees have been paid.

If all the independent claims in the category in question have been deemed to be abandoned because the fees were not paid, no invitation under Rule 62a(1) will be issued and none of them will be searched.4.5 Applications falling under Rule 62a and lacking unity

There are cases where the application not only does not comply with Rule 43(2) (see B‑VIII, 4.1 and F‑IV, 3.2) but also lacks unity of invention under Art. 82 and Rule 44. Sometimes it is enough for the search division to raise only the issue of unity of invention and send an invitation under Rule 64(1) (see B‑VII, 1.1 and B-VII, 1.2).

In other cases, however, the search division may need to apply the procedures under both Rule 64(1) (i.e. invite the applicant to pay further search fees for inventions other than the one first mentioned in the claims) and Rule 62a(1) (i.e. invite the applicant to indicate the independent claims to be searched). It will then send the applicant the invitation under Rule 62a(1) first.

Where the lack of unity is already apparent when the invitation under Rule 62a(1) is sent, it will also identify the invention (or group of inventions) first mentioned in the claims ("first invention" ‒ see F‑V, 3.4) and the claims which relate to it, either in full or in part, and ask the applicant to indicate which claims to search. If the applicant has not replied by expiry of the time limit under Rule 62a(1), the claims to be searched for the first invention will be determined according to the procedures described in B‑VIII, 4.2. A partial search report will then be drawn up on this first invention and sent to the applicant, along with an invitation to pay further search fees under Rule 64(1) for the other inventions and a provisional opinion on the first invention's patentability that includes the reasons for the non-unity findings. Where appropriate, this invitation under Rule 64(1) may also include an invitation under Rule 62a(1) asking the applicant to clarify the claims to be searched in respect of any other inventions for which they later pay further search fees.

However, it can also happen that, after the invitation under Rule 62a(1) has been sent for all claims, the claims which comply with Rule 43(2) and so are searched (as determined according to the procedures in B‑VIII, 4.2) are found to be open to an objection of lack of unity a posteriori. An invitation to pay further search fees under Rule 64(1) will then be sent, but only in relation to the subject-matter of the claims determined by the applicant's reply (or lack of reply) to the invitation under Rule 62a(1).

Where these exceptional circumstances arise in cases of supplementary European search reports on Euro-PCT applications, the procedure is the same, except that a Rule 164(1) invitation is sent instead of a Rule 64 invitation.

Rule 164

Rule 62a also applies to searches performed under Rule 164(2) (see C‑III, 3.1). As for searches on directly filed European patent applications, any Rule 62a objection relating to an invention for which a search fee has to be paid must be included in the invitation to pay that fee.

Rule 1644.6 Handling of dependent claims under Rule 62a

Claims depending ‒ whether directly or only indirectly via other dependent claims ‒ on an independent claim excluded from the search in accordance with Rule 62a(1) (see B‑VIII, 4.2) are likewise excluded from the search. Conversely, if a dependent claim depends on more than one preceding claim and not all of them were searched, it will be searched but only in so far as it depends on a claim or claims which were searched in accordance with Rule 62a(1).5. Invitation under both Rule 62a(1) and Rule 63(1)

It is sometimes necessary to send an invitation under both Rule 63 (see B‑VIII, 3.1) and Rule 62a(1) (see B‑VIII, 4.1), for example where clarifying which claim or claims to search under Rule 62a will not necessarily help to clarify what subject-matter to search, because the application contains several independent claims in the same category and none or only some of them can be meaningfully searched over their whole scope. The invitations under Rule 62a(1) and Rule 63(1) are then sent jointly in a single communication setting the same two-month time limit for replying under both rules. Applicants wishing to reply to both invitations should do so at the same time.

The independent claims indicated in reply to the invitation under Rule 62a(1) and the subject-matter indicated in reply to the invitation under Rule 63(1) must be compatible. If the applicant's indications are incompatible, the search division can choose, depending on the circumstances, either (i) to search the claims indicated by the applicant under Rule 62a(1) and, where necessary, limit the subject-matter searched for those claims by applying Rule 63(2) by analogy or (ii) to search that subject-matter defined in the first independent claim in a particular category which is compatible with the subject-matter indicated by the applicant under Rule 63(1) by applying Rule 62a(1), last sentence, by analogy.

Although sent in the same communication, the invitations under Rule 62a(1) and Rule 63(1) are still legally separate. Applicants are therefore free to reply to only one of them. If they reply only to the Rule 62a(1) invitation, option (i) above applies. If they reply only to the Rule 63(1) invitation, option (ii) above applies.6. Claims contravening Art. 123(2) or Art. 76(1)

If the claims on which the search is to be based were filed after the filing date or under Rule 58, they are not part of the application documents "as originally filed". Similarly, the supplementary European search on a Euro-PCT application is sometimes based on amended claims (see B‑III, 3.3.1). In either case, before starting the search, the search division checks whether or not these claims add any subject-matter that goes beyond what was in the application "as originally filed" (see also A‑III, 15). For Euro-PCT applications, this means the PCT application as originally filed.

If the claims contravene Art. 123(2), the search division will face one of the following situations:

(a)there are doubts about whether an objection can be raised (e.g. the amendment relies on common general knowledge and the search division is unsure whether the introduced term can be based on this) and/or the amendment does not significantly change the scope and subject-matter of the search: the search division then searches the claims as they are.

(b)there are certain individual features in the claims that clearly contravene Art. 123(2): the search division then ignores these features when carrying out the search.

(c)there are substantial non-allowable amendments in the claims: the search division may then need to issue an invitation under Rule 63(1) before starting the search (see B‑VIII, 3(iv)). Depending on the reply to the invitation, it may issue a partial search report or even a declaration replacing the search report under Rule 63. In deciding what to include in the search and what to exclude from it, it refers to how the invention is defined in the description.

A similar problem can also arise when a divisional application is filed and the amended claims do not meet the requirements of Art. 76(1): the same criteria as described in steps (a) to (c) above are then applied.

In any case, the search opinion will include an objection under Art. 123(2) or Art. 76(1) and give the reasons for limiting the scope of the search.

1. General

2. Patent documents arranged for systematic searching

3. Non-patent literature arranged for systematic access

4. Non-patent literature arranged for library-type access

5. Access to EPO documentation for the national patent offices1. General

1.1 Organisation and content of the documentation available to the search divisions

1.2 Means of searching systematically1.1 Organisation and content of the documentation available to the search divisions

The search documentation consists mainly of a collection of patent documents that can be systematically accessed in a way that facilitates searching. It also includes non-patent literature – such as periodicals and other technical publications – that can be accessed via in-house and external databases, with some items also available for consultation in a virtual library. Particularly relevant items of non-patent literature are selected for inclusion in the systematically accessible documentation. The systematically accessible part of the search documentation includes the minimum documentation that an International Searching Authority must consult under Rules 34 PCT and Rule 36.1(ii) PCT but goes beyond these minimum requirements.1.2 Means of searching systematically

The search documentation can be searched using the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC), which is based on the International Patent Classification (IPC) but comprises finer internal subdivisions, or using other classification systems and/or words.2. Patent documents arranged for systematic searching

2.1 PCT minimum documentation

2.2 Unpublished patent applications

2.3 Search reports

2.4 Patent family system2.1 PCT minimum documentation

The systematically accessible search documentation includes the national patent documents belonging to the PCT minimum documentation specified in Rule 34.1(b)(i) PCT and Rule 34.1(c) PCT.

It also includes published international (PCT) and regional (e.g. European) patent applications, patents and inventors' certificates (Rule 34.1(b)(ii) PCT).

A complete list of the contents of the PCT minimum documentation is available on the WIPO website.2.2 Unpublished patent applications

Since it is for the examining division to complete the search for any conflicting applications that were still not published at the time of the initial search, unpublished patent applications are not among the documents which can be cited in the search report and so are not in the search documentation (see B‑VI, 4.1).2.3 Search reports

The official European and international (PCT) search reports are normally published together with the European and international applications and are included in the search files together with these applications. The official search reports for national applications are also included in these files where they are publicly available, as are any unofficial search reports. Search reports that are not normally or not yet publicly available in the form of a published document are available to the search division separately from the state-of-the-art documents, but it is not compulsory to search them for all applications.2.4 Patent family system

The EPO keeps a patent family system based on application and priority data of the patent documents stored in its databases. Normally, just one representative document of a patent family is displayed on screen, but there will be links to the other family members.3. Non-patent literature arranged for systematic access

3.1 Periodicals, records, reports, books, etc.3.1 Periodicals, records, reports, books, etc.

The systematically accessible search documentation includes relevant articles from the list drawn up by the competent WIPO body of periodicals belonging to the minimum documentation under the PCT and from other periodicals the search divisions consider useful. Copies of the articles selected as relevant for search purposes are generally added to the EPO search databases with a fictitious country code "XP" and scanned for inclusion in the electronic "BNS" collection.

The EPO also subscribes to many other periodicals, including abstract journals, and obtains records of conference proceedings, reports, books, standards, etc. in all three of its official languages and covering the various technically important geographical areas. Individual items are selected for inclusion in the online documentation if they are useful additions to the state of the art.4. Non-patent literature arranged for library-type access

4.1 Content4.1 Content

In addition to the non-patent literature mainly used for search purposes (see B‑IX, 3), the non-patent literature arranged for library-type access also includes literature which the search division can use as sources of information and for professional development and which covers not only general and background technical information but also new technical developments. The collection also includes reports, pamphlets, etc. Internet-based document delivery services of publishing companies are available to the search division members via an electronic virtual library (EVL).5. Access to EPO documentation for the national patent offices

The EPO provides the national offices of its member states with access to its electronic search documentation described in B‑IX, 2.1 to B-IX, 2.3.

Access to the EPO's other documentation may be limited if it is delivered by commercial database providers. This depends on the conditions of data delivery agreed between the EPO and the individual data provider. However, national offices may also have their own separate agreements with data providers.Chapter X – Search report

The search report records the results of the search. Its scope is limited in the following cases:

(i)claims are treated as abandoned because the claims fees were not paid (Rule 45(3), see B‑III, 3.4)

(ii)no search was possible and so a declaration under Rule 63 is issued instead (see B‑VIII)

(iii)a partial search report is issued under Rule 63 and/or Rule 62a (see B‑VIII)

(iv)a partial European search report is issued owing to a lack of unity under Rule 64(1)

(v)a supplementary European search report under Art. 153(7) is incomplete for the reasons given in (i) or (iii) (Rule 162(4) applies if there are unpaid claims fees) or is replaced by a declaration for the reason in (ii).

The search reports issued in cases (i) – (iii) (and (v) where incomplete for one of the reasons in (i) – (iii)) are sent to the applicant, published and used as a basis for the examination by the examining division. A partial search report issued under Rule 64(1) (case (iv)) is also transmitted to the applicant, but not published; however, it can still be inspected by the public as it is included in the electronic file accessible via the European Patent Register (see A‑XI, 2).

Except in the cases mentioned in B‑XI, 7, European search reports and supplementary European search reports are accompanied by a search opinion giving the search division's view on whether the application and the invention concerned seem to meet the requirements of the EPC (see B‑XI, 1.1). Together, the European search report or supplementary European search report and the search opinion make up the extended European search report (EESR).

The search division is responsible for drawing up the European search report. It is also responsible for drafting international search reports and search reports on behalf of the industrial property offices of some EPC contracting states (see B‑X, 2 and B‑II, 4.4 to B-II, 4.6).

This chapter provides the information the search division needs to properly draw up the search report.

A search report must not contain anything, in particular any expressions of opinion, reasoning, arguments or explanations, beyond what has to be entered on the form used and the opinions mentioned in B‑III, 1.1 and B-III, 1.2 or B‑X, 9.2.8. However, this does not apply to the search opinion (see B‑XI, 3).

Rule 62(1)2. Different types of search report drawn up by the EPO

The EPO search divisions draw up the following types of search report:

(i)European search reports (see B‑II, 4.1)

(ii)supplementary European search reports on PCT applications (see B‑II, 4.3)

(iii)"search results under Rule 164(2)" (see C‑III, 3.1)

(iv)international search reports under the PCT (see B‑II, 4.4)

(v)international-type search reports (see B‑II, 4.5)

(vi)search reports for national offices (see B‑II, 4.6)

(vii)search reports produced as part of special activities.

The results of any additional searches carried out at the examination stage (see B‑II, 4.2) are also recorded but are not published. However, the documents found may be used in the examination proceedings (see C‑IV, 7.3).

This chapter sets out the requirements for search reports of types (i) to (v) only. Nevertheless, all search reports drawn up by the EPO search divisions should be as similar as possible.3. Form and language of the search report

3.1 Form

3.2 Language

3.3 Search summary

3.4 Record of search strategy3.1 Form

The standard search report has a main page used for all searches to record the most important information, including:

(i)the application number

(ii)the application's classification

(iii)the technical fields searched

(iv)the relevant documents found in the search

(v)the name of the search division member who carried out the search

plus supplemental sheet A and, in certain cases, also supplemental sheet B.

Supplemental sheet A is used for recording whether the title, the abstract as filed by the applicant and the figure to be published with the abstract were approved or amended and for providing the translation of the title into the other two official languages (see B‑X, 7).

Supplemental sheet B has to be filled in if the search was restricted, i.e. when claims were not searched because the claims fees had not been paid (see B‑III, 3.4), when there is a lack of unity of invention (see B‑VII), when a meaningful search was not possible and so the search report is either incomplete or replaced entirely by a declaration under Rule 63 (see B‑VIII, 3) or when the search was limited under Rule 62a (see B‑VIII, 4).

Dates are given in the format specified in WIPO standard ST.2.3.2 Language

The search report or the declaration accompanying or replacing it under Rule 63 is drawn up in the language of the proceedings.

Art. 14(3) Rule 61(5)3.3 Search summary

For in-house quality assurance purposes, the search division summarises all the information needed by the auditors to understand what has been searched (see B‑III, 3), where (see B‑III, 2) and how (see B‑IV, 2). This summary of the search is not made publicly available.3.4 Record of search strategy

An "Information on Search Strategy" sheet is automatically added to all EPO search reports. It lists the databases searched, classification symbols used and keywords reflecting the searched subject-matter.4. Identification of the European patent application and the search report type

The European patent application concerned is identified on the main page and supplemental sheets by its application number.

The search report type is also specified.

Where the application and the search report are published together, the main page of the report is marked A1 (WIPO Standard ST.16). If the application is published before the search is carried out, the main page is marked A2 (WIPO Standard ST.16). The later search report is drawn up on a new main page marked A3 (WIPO Standard ST.16). If it is a supplementary European search report for an international application, the new main page is marked A4 (WIPO Standard ST.16).

Art. 153(7)5. Classification of the European patent application

The main page of the search report shows the IPC classification symbol or symbols assigned to the European patent application (see B‑V, 3).

If the application is published before the search report has been drawn up (A2 publication, see B‑X, 4), the search division will fill in supplemental sheet A in time for its publication, entering all the necessary information mentioned in B‑X, 7 and the application's IPC classification (see B‑V, 3.3 on cases where the application lacks unity).

The IPC classification is shown again on the separately published search report (A3 publication, see B‑X, 4). If, in the meantime, the search division has changed the IPC classification initially assigned and shown on the A2 publication, it is the new classification that will appear on the later published search report (see B‑V, 3.1).6. Technical fields searched

Although not required by the EPC, the European search report includes the technical fields searched in the form of a list of IPC symbols describing them down to the sub-class level.

Where the search report is based entirely or partly on a previous search carried out for an application relating to similar subject-matter, the report displays the parts of the documentation consulted for this previous search as the ones consulted for the application in question, again by using the appropriate IPC symbols.7. Title, abstract and figure to be published with the abstract (as indicated on supplemental sheet A)

The search division fills in supplemental sheet A before publication of the application, regardless of whether it is going to be published with the search report (A1 publication) or without it (A2 publication), because the information entered there is needed to publish the application.

On supplemental sheet A, the search division indicates:

(i)approval or amendment of the abstract's wording, which is communicated to the applicant under Rule 66 (see A‑III, 10). The search division does not study the abstract beyond ensuring that it relates to the application and does not conflict with the invention's title or the application's classification. Since the abstract has to relate to the application as filed, the search division will consider it and decide on its final wording before carrying out the search, in order to avoid being inadvertently influenced by the search results.

If the search report is published separately (A3 publication), no information about the abstract is given on supplemental sheet A. The information sent to the applicant includes the invention's title and any figure of the drawings to be published with the abstract.

In exceptional cases, the search division may change the abstract after the search but, if the application has already been published (A2 publication), supplemental sheet A will not be reissued.

Rule 47(1) Rule 66

(ii)approval or amendment of the invention's title (see A‑III, 7)

Rule 41(2)(b)

(iii)approval, change or omission of any figure selected by the applicant to accompany the abstract (see F‑II, 2.3(vi) and F-II, 2.4)

Rule 47(4)

(iv)the translation of the European patent application's title into the two other official languages.

The European Patent Bulletin is published in all three of the EPO's official languages (Art. 14(7)(a)) and contains the entries made in the European Patent Register. These entries include the invention's title (Rule 143(1)(c)) and so it must be available in all three official languages.

The above applies equally to applications published with the search report (A1 publication) and those published without it (A2 publication). In an A2 publication, supplemental sheet A also shows the application's IPC classification (see B‑X, 5). In an A1 publication, the IPC classification appears only on the search report (Rule 61(6)).

Supplemental sheet A also specifies whether it relates to an A1 or an A2 publication.

In the case of a supplementary European search report on an international application, supplemental sheet A is marked A4. The search division does not decide on the title, abstract or figure to be published with the abstract, as the ISA will already have decided on them under Rules 37.2 PCT, 38.2(a), Rules 38 PCT and Rules 8.2 PCT, respectively.

Art. 14(7)(a)8. Restriction of the searched subject-matter

In the following cases, the search report, the declaration of no search or the partial search report will state that the search was restricted and which claims have or have not been searched:

(i)claims above the number of fifteen for which no additional fee has been paid (see B‑III, 3.4). This only applies to European and supplementary European search reports.

Rule 45(1) and Rule 45(3) Rule 162(1) and Rule 162(4)

(ii)lack of unity of invention (see B‑VII). The partial search report (see B‑VII, 1.1) points out that it has been drawn up for the invention first mentioned in the claims and is accompanied by a list of the different inventions identified which specifies their subject-matter and the claims or parts of claims that relate to them (see Rule 44(2). This applies regardless of whether the lack of unity is detected "a priori" or "a posteriori". Any search report later drawn up for all the inventions for which search fees have been paid will specify the different inventions searched (and the related claims or parts of claims).

Rule 64(1)

(iii)claims for which no meaningful search or only an incomplete search could be carried out (see B‑VIII). The search division then declares:

(a)that a meaningful search could not be carried out for any of the claims (this declaration replaces the search report) or

(b)that a meaningful search could not be carried out for one or more of the claims or parts of them. The claims concerned are specified in this declaration, which is issued together with the partial search report.

In both cases (a) and (b), the reasons for not carrying out the search or for restricting it must be given (e.g. subject-matter not patentable; insufficiently clear claims). If necessary, full reasoning is provided in the search opinion; see B‑VIII, 3.3 for the content of the EESR in these cases.

Rule 63 Art. 52(2) Art. 53

(iv)claims not searched because they do not comply with Rule 43(2) (see B‑VIII, 4.2).

9.1.1 Bibliographic data

9.1.2 "Corresponding documents"

9.1.3 Language of the documents cited

9.1.4 Supplementary European search report9.1.1 Bibliographic data

All documents cited in the search report must be clearly identified by indicating the necessary bibliographic data. All citations in the search report normally comply with the recommendations in WIPO Standards ST.14 (for including references cited in patent documents), ST.3 (for two-letter codes) and ST.16 (for identifying different kinds of patent documents), but there can be exceptions where strictly adhering to them would entail a lot of extra work and cost and is not necessary to enable a document to be clearly and easily identified.9.1.2 "Corresponding documents"

The search division will often come across "corresponding" documents (see B‑VI, 6.2), i.e. documents which have the same or substantially the same technical content. These are usually either patent documents from the same patent family or abstracts.

(i)Patent documents in the same patent family

These are patent documents which are from the same country or from different countries and share at least one claimed priority.

If a cited patent document belongs to a patent family, the search division does not cite all the other family members it knows of and can understand, as they are anyway mentioned in the annex to the search report. However, it may choose to mention one or more members in addition to the one cited (see B‑IV, 3.1). These documents are identified by naming the office they originate from, specifying their type and number and placing them after an ampersand sign (&). There are various possible reasons why the search division may wish to draw attention in the search report to more than one document in the same patent family:

(a)One document in the patent family was published before the earliest priority date of the application but in a non‑EPO language, whereas another member of the same patent family was published in an EPO language (see Art. 14(1)) but after the earliest priority date of the application.

Example

A European application claims a priority of 3 September 1999. The search on this application uncovers a relevant document WO 99 12395 A, which was published in Japanese on 11 March 1999 and so in time to qualify as prior art under Art. 54(2). There is also the European family member published as an English translation under Art. 153(4) on 1 March 2000. That is too late for it to be prior art under Art. 54(2), but it can be cited in the search report as an "&" document of the Japanese-language WO publication and made available to the applicant (see B‑X, 11.3). It will then be used to interpret the content of the Japanese WO publication when the application is examined (see G‑IV, 4). In the search report, these documents would be cited as shown below (on the linking of cited documents to the claims they relate to ‒ here: claims 1-10 ‒ see B‑X, 9.3).

X WO 99 12395 A (SEKI SHUNICHI; KIGUCHI HIROSHI (JP); SEIKO EPOSON CORP (JP)) 11 March 1999 (1999-03-11) * figure 1 * & EP 0 982 974 (SEIKO EPSON CORP) 1 March 2000 (2000-03-01) * figure 1 * * claim 1 * 1-10

(b)There are several different documents in the same patent family and each one contains relevant technical subject-matter not found in the other family members.

(c)The application cites a family member drafted in a non‑EPO language but there is another family member in an EPO language, and both were published before the application's earliest priority date.

Example

Y WO9001867 A (WIDEGREN LARS (SE)) 8 March 1990 (1990-03-08) * claim 1 * 1-10 D,Y & SE461824 B (WIDEGREN LARS (SE)) 2 April 1990 (1990-04-02) 1-10

By citing the relevant SE document, which is a family member of the relevant WO document, in the application, the applicant has already met the requirement that the state of the art be mentioned in the description (Rule 42(1)(b)). It is important to make the examining division aware of this by mentioning it in the search report (see F‑II, 4.3).

(ii)Abstracts (see B‑VI, 6.2)

Abstracts are provided by several database providers (e.g. Chemical Abstracts or Derwent) and cover many different types of disclosure (e.g. patent documents, journal articles, PhD theses, books). They summarise the most important aspects of the original document's technical content. Most abstracts cited are in English. Whenever citing an abstract in the search report, the search division must always enter the original document to which it relates after the "&" sign.

Example

X DATABASE WPI Week 200961 Thomson Scientific, London, GB; AN 2009-N01904 & WO 2009/104990 A1 (VALEXPHARM CO LTD) 27 August 2009 (2009-08-27) * abstract * 1-5

There are various reasons why the search division may choose to cite the abstract rather than the original document (in which case the original document must instead be mentioned as an "&" document). For instance, the original document may not be readily available to it (e.g. a PhD thesis) or it may be in a non‑EPO language (e.g. a journal article in Russian) and there is no corresponding document. The original document is made available to the applicant only if it has been earmarked for this by the search division (see B‑X, 12).

If the search division wants to refer to a published Japanese or Korean patent application (with kind code A), it cites the Japanese or Korean publication in the search report. If an English abstract is available in the EPO databases (Patent Abstracts of Japan or Patent Abstracts of Korea), both the Japanese or Korean publication and the English abstract are made available to the applicant. A machine translation is also made available (see B‑X, 9.1.3 and B-X 12, and G‑IV, 4.1).9.1.3 Language of the documents cited

Members of the same patent family are often published in various different languages. The search division therefore has a choice as to the language in which it wishes to cite such a document in the search report. If the relevant technical content of the various family members is the same and they were all published before the earliest priority date of the application, they are all equally relevant to the application. The search division chooses which one of them to cite by looking at the languages they were published in and applying the following order of preference:

(1) an official EPO language (i.e. English, French or German (Art. 14(1))

(2) an official language of an EPC contracting state under Art. 14(4) (see A‑VII, 1.1) ‒ the document can usually be read by a colleague if the search division member in charge is not familiar with this language (see B‑VI, 6.2)

(3) a language other than those of the EPC contracting states.

In cases (2) and (3), the search division might consider citing an abstract in an official EPO language instead of the original document.

If the original document is in a language the search division cannot readily understand (e.g. Chinese or Russian), it is best to cite the abstract. It is possible to obtain a machine translation of a patent document into an official EPO language. If the search division relies on this translation in the search opinion, the This machine translation will be made available to the applicant (see B‑X, 12 and G‑IV, 4).

Alternatively, if only a specific paragraph of the machine translation is needed, the search division may copy that paragraph into the search opinion, instead of making but the full machine translation will be made available to the applicant as well. However, where a full translation was available during search, this full translation will normally be made available to the applicant.

Non-official translations (i.e. translations with no legal value) of publications in a language the search division cannot readily understand (e.g. Russian, Japanese, Korean or Chinese) will not be cited in the search report.9.1.4 Supplementary European search report

In certain circumstances, it is permissible not to cite any documents at all in a supplementary European search report under Art. 153(7) (see B‑IV, 2.5). The search report will then include the phrase "No further relevant documents disclosed", but the search opinion (if applicable ‒ see B‑XI, 7) will give an opinion on whether the claimed invention seems to be patentable over the state of the art cited in the international search report (B‑XI, 1.1).

Even if the search division disagrees with the ISA's opinion on the relevance of a document cited in the international search report for assessing the novelty and/or inventive step of the claimed invention, it normally does not cite the document again in the supplementary European search report with a new, corrected document category. The exception to this is where it wants to combine a first document falling under category Y (see B‑X, 9.2.1) and not found until its supplementary European search with another document already cited in the international search report: it may then choose to cite the other document from the international search report again in its supplementary European search report as a "Y" document in combination with the first document. Where this recategorising of the document does not affect all the claims, this is clarified in the supplementary European search report in order to ensure consistency with the European search opinion.9.2 Categories of documents (X, Y, P, A, D, etc.)

All documents cited in the search report are assigned to one of the categories explained in more detail below by placing the relevant letter in the first column of the citation sheets. Categories can be combined if necessary.

9.2.1 Particularly relevant documents

9.2.2 Documents defining the state of the art and not prejudicing novelty or inventive step

9.2.3 Documents which refer to a non-written disclosure

9.2.4 Intermediate documents

9.2.5 Documents relating to the theory or principle behind the invention

9.2.6 Potentially conflicting patent documents

9.2.7 Documents cited in the application

9.2.8 Documents cited for other reasons9.2.1 Particularly relevant documents

Where a document cited in the search report is particularly relevant, it is labelled with the letter "X" or "Y". Category "X" applies where a document shows on its own that a claimed invention cannot be considered novel or to involve an inventive step.

Art. 52(1) Art. 54 Art. 56

Category "Y" applies where a document suggests that a claimed invention cannot be considered to involve an inventive step when the document is combined with one or more other documents of the same category and this combination is obvious to a person skilled in the art. However, if a document (called a "primary document") explicitly refers to another document as providing more detailed information on certain features (see G‑IV, 8) and the combination of these documents is considered particularly relevant, the primary document is labelled with the letter "X", i.e. not "Y", and the document it refers to (the "secondary document") is labelled with "X" or "L" as appropriate.

Art. 52(1) Art. 569.2.2 Documents defining the state of the art and not prejudicing novelty or inventive step

Where a document cited in the search report represents state of the art that does not prejudice the novelty or inventive step of the claimed invention, it is labelled with the letter "A" (see, however, B‑III, 1.1).9.2.3 Documents which refer to a non-written disclosure

Where a document cited in the search report refers to a non-written disclosure (e.g. conference proceedings), it is labelled with the letter "O'' (see B‑VI, 2). For oral disclosures that took place at an officially recognised exhibition (Art. 55(1)(b)), see B‑VI, 5.5. The document category "O" is always accompanied by one of the letters explained in B‑X, 9.2.1 and B-X, 9.2.2 to indicate its level of relevance. So e.g. "O, X", "O, Y" or "O, A".

Rule 61(4)9.2.4 Intermediate documents

Documents published between the priority date claimed in the searched application ‒ or the earliest priority date if there is more than one (see B‑VI, 5.2 and B‑XI, 4) ‒ and its filing date are labelled with the letter "P". The letter "P" is also used for a document published on the very day of the earliest priority date claimed. The document category "P" is always accompanied by one of the letters explained in B‑X, 9.2.1 and B-X, 9.2.2 to indicate its level of relevance. So e.g. "P, X", "P, Y" or "P, A".

Rule 61(3)9.2.5 Documents relating to the theory or principle behind the invention

Where a document cited in the search report may be useful for a better understanding of the principle or theory behind the invention or shows that the reasoning or the facts behind it are incorrect, it is labelled with the letter "T".

In the latter case, the "T" document is evidence within the meaning of Art. 117(1)(c) rather than prior art within the meaning of Art. 54(2) and so it does not matter whether it was published before or after the searched application's priority or filing date.

For example: an applicant claims a group of chemical compounds and the description gives a generically defined process for their production. The search division finds a document published after the priority date which clearly shows that the generically defined process cannot produce all of the compounds covered by the claims. It can then cite it as a "T" document and use it to raise an Art. 84 objection that the claims are not supported by the description (see F‑IV, 6.3).9.2.6 Potentially conflicting patent documents

Any patent document which has a filing or priority date before the searched application's filing date (not its priority date – see B‑VI, 3 and B‑XI, 4) but was published on or after that date and whose content could potentially constitute prior art relevant to novelty (Art. 54(1)) is labelled with the letter "E". This label is also assigned where the patent document and the searched application have the same filing date (see G‑IV, 5.4). However, patent documents claiming the same priority as the searched application do not fall in this category and are not cited.

Art. 54(3) Art. 139(2)9.2.7 Documents cited in the application

When the search report cites documents already mentioned in the searched application's description, these are labelled with the letter "D" (see B‑IV, 1.3).

Rule 42(1)(b)9.2.8 Documents cited for other reasons

Where the search report cites a document for reasons other than those referred to above (in particular as evidence – see B‑VI, 5.6), for example because it:

(a)casts doubt on a priority claim (see B‑VI, 5.3)

(b)establishes the publication date of another citation (see B‑VI, 5.6)

(c)is relevant to the issue of double patenting (see B‑IV, 2.3(v) and G‑IV, 5.4),

it is labelled with the letter "L" and brief reasons for citing it are given. In the special case that the search division considers the claimed subject-matter to be notorious and so no documentary evidence is needed (see B‑VIII, 2.2), it will give the reasoning behind not citing any prior-art documents in the search opinion.

A citation of an "L" document does not need not be linked to any of the claims (see B‑X, 9.3) unless the evidence it provides relates only to particular claims (e.g. it shows the priority claim is invalid for only some claims), in which case the claims affected must be specified.

Art. 117(1)(c)9.3 Relationship between documents and claims

Each document cited in the search report is accompanied by an indication of the claims to which it relates, unless it falls in category "L" (see B‑X, 9.2.8). The same document can be cited in different categories for different claims, but the specific claims it relates to in each category must be indicated.

Example

X WO9001867 A (WIDEGREN LARS (SE)) 8 March 1990 (1990-03-08) 1 Y * column 3, line 27 – line 43; figure 1 * 2-5 A * figure 2 * 6-10

The document cited in the above example discloses subject-matter which prejudices the novelty or inventive step of the subject-matter of claim 1 and, when the document is combined with another one cited in the search report, the inventive step of the subject-matter of claims 2 to 5 and which also represents non-prejudicial state of the art for the subject-matter of claims 6 to 10. The passages or figures are not necessarily relevant to the claims and the category indicated on the same line.

Generally speaking, all claims are mentioned in the search report at least once in relation to at least one document published before the earliest priority date (unless a particular claim was not searched because the search was restricted as described in B‑X, 8) (see B‑IV, 2.5).

Rule 61(2)9.4 Identification of relevant passages in prior-art documents

If a cited document is very long, the search division will identify the specific parts (e.g. claim, example, figure, table, text passage on a particular page, or a specific time or time range in a video and/or audio media fragment) which contain the technical subject-matter closest to (or coinciding with) the searched invention. This is particularly important where the document is relied on to support objections to novelty or inventive step.

Where the search division relies on a translation of a prior-art document, it will indicate the relevant passages in the original document whenever possible.

It makes sense to cite not only those parts of the document describing the same or similar technical subject-matter but also those parts or passages relating to the problem solved by that subject-matter. This makes it easier to assess inventive step in examination and also gives the applicant a better idea of how the document may be used during the proceedings.

Rule 61(2)10. Authentication and dates

The search report shows the date on which it was drawn up, i.e. the date it was drafted by the search division member who carried out the search.

The member's name must also appear on the search report.11. Copies to be made available with the search report

11.1 General remarks

11.2 Electronic version of cited document

11.3 Patent family members; the "&" sign

11.4 Reviews or books

11.5 Summaries, extracts or abstracts

11.6 Citation of video and/or audio media fragments available on the internet11.1 General remarks

The search report is sent to the applicant and transmitted to the examining division. Copies of all the cited documents are made available to the applicant (see also B‑IV, 3.3), except for those documents appearing in the search report after the "&" symbol which the search division has not earmarked for this (see B‑X, 11.3).

These cited documents are then used to assess the patentability of the claimed invention (see B‑XI, 3) both in the search opinion (if applicable ‒ see B‑XI, 7) and in the examination proceedings.

Rule 6511.2 Electronic version of cited document

In the case of patent documents, a complete copy is made available.

If a document has been published in electronic form only (see Rule 68(2) and OJ EPO 2000, 367), an electronic version is made available to the applicant. If only parts of it are not available in paper form, then at least those parts will be made available as an electronic version. At any rate, the applicant must ultimately be provided with the whole document either as a combination of paper and electronic versions or in electronic form only.11.3 Patent family members; the "&" sign

In the case of patent families, only a copy of the family member actually cited is normally made available. The other members are mentioned in an automatically generated annex produced for information only (see B‑X, 9.1.2). However, in certain circumstances one or more other patent documents in the same patent family may be mentioned on the search report after the "&" sign (see B‑X, 9.1.2(i)). The search division may decide that copies of these patent documents should also be made available to the applicant (they will then be included in the examination file too, and can be referred to in any search opinion).11.4 Reviews or books

In the case of a review or a book, copies of the relevant pages are made available to the applicant. The relevant bibliographic information has to be clear from the these copies.11.5 Summaries, extracts or abstracts

Where a document cited is a summary, extract or abstract of another, separately published document, a copy of the summary, extract or abstract is made available to the applicant.

If, however, the search division considers that the whole source document is needed, that document must be cited and a copy must be made available to the applicant (see B‑X, 9.1.2(ii)).

When an online search in a database (e.g. CAS References, CAS Registry, COMPENDEX, INSPEC, NTIS) is performed and the original document referred to in the database is not available at the EPO when the search report is drafted, the extract is added to the file instead of the original.11.6 Citation of video and/or audio media fragments available on the internet

Video and/or audio media fragments available on the internet are converted into a non-patent literature citation. The bibliographic data include the URL of the original location on the internet.

If these citations cease to be available on the internet, a copy will be made available to the applicant on request (see G‑IV, 7.5.6).12. Transmittal of the search report and search opinion

The EPO forwards the search report and the search opinion (if applicable ‒ see B‑XI, 7) to the applicant and makes copies of all cited documents available to them (see B‑X, 11.1), including any machine translations (see B‑X, 9.1.3) and any documents appearing after the "&" sign that the search division has earmarked for this (see B‑X, 11.3).

The extended European search report (EESR) is made up of two items:

(i)the European search report or the supplementary European search report (see B‑X)

(ii)the search opinion.

Rule 62(1)

1.1 The search opinion

1.2 Position of the examining division1.1 The search opinion

For European patent applications filed as of 1 July 2005 and international applications filed as of that date that enter the European phase, European search reports and supplementary European search reports will be accompanied by an opinion on whether the application and the invention dealt with seem to meet the EPC requirements.

This does not apply in the cases referred to in B‑XI, 7.

The findings in the search opinion must be in line with the document categories assigned in the search report and with any other issues raised there, such as lack of unity of invention or any limitation of the search.1.2 Position of the examining division

The examining division will consider any objections raised in the search opinion and the applicant's response to them (see B‑XI, 8) when examining the application. It may change the position taken in the search opinion after receiving arguments, amendments and other submissions from the applicant in response to the search opinion or subsequently in examination proceedings. Irrespective of any such submissions, it may also alter the position if it finds Art. 54(3) state of the art when carrying out a top-up search or if it is made aware of additional state of the art either by the applicant or in observations filed by third parties under Art. 115 (see also B‑IV, 3.2, C‑IV, 7.3 and C-IV, 7.4).

The examining division can also reverse the findings in the search opinion for other reasons (see B‑III, 1.1), but this is rare.2. Basis for the search opinion

Where a European patent application is not based on an international application, the applicant cannot amend it before receiving the search report. This means that the search opinion will always deal with the application documents as originally filed although it will also take account of any reply from the applicant to an invitation under Rule 63(1) (see B‑VIII, 3.4).

Art. 123(1) Rule 137(1)

However, if it is based on an international application and undergoes a supplementary European search under Art. 153(7) (see B‑II, 4.3), the applicant will have had an opportunity to amend it both in the international phase and on entry into the European phase. The search opinion will then be based on the application documents which the applicant has most recently asked to be processed (this may involve cancelling previously filed amendments and reverting to parts or all of an earlier set of application documents). The supplementary European search report will also relate to these application documents (see B‑II, 4.3 and B‑III, 3.3.2).

Where the search opinion and supplementary European search report deal with amended application documents but the requirements in Rule 137(4) have not been met (see H‑III, 2.1), a communication asking the applicant to meet these requirements (see B‑VIII, 6 and H‑III, 2.1.1) cannot be sent yet (i.e. before the search opinion is drawn up) because the examining division is still not responsible for the application (see C‑II, 1). Once it does take charge of the application, it can send this communication, but only if the amendments in question have not since been withdrawn or superseded (see H‑III, 2.1.1) and only if the application is of one of the types listed in H‑III, 2.1.4.

Rule 161(2) Rule 159(1)(b) Art. 19 PCT Art. 34(2)(b) PCT

2.1 Application documents filed under Rule 56 EPC, Rule 56a EPC, Rule 20.5 PCT or Rule 20.5bis PCT

2.2 Applications containing claims filed after the accorded filing date2.1 Application documents filed under Rule 56 EPC, Rule 56a EPC, Rule 20.5 PCT or Rule 20.5bis PCT

If the Receiving Section decided not to redate the application under Rule 56(2) or Rule 56(5) or under Rule 56a(3) or Rule 56a(6), but the search division considers that the subsequently filed missing parts or correct application documents or parts are not "completely contained" in the priority document and/or the requirements of Rule 56(3) or Rule 56a(4) are not met, its search will also take into account prior art which would potentially become relevant for assessing novelty and inventive step of the subject-matter claimed if the application were redated under Rule 56(2) or Rule 56(5) or under Rule 56a(3) or Rule 56a(6). The search opinion must include a warning that the application seems not to meet the requirements in Rule 56 or Rule 56a for keeping the accorded filing date, a statement of reasons as to why this is the case and an indication that a formal decision on whether to redate the application will be taken by the examining division at a later stage. If appropriate, the search opinion can also comment on the effect redating would have on the priority claim and/or the status of the prior-art documents cited in the search report.

A similar procedure is followed for a Euro-PCT application. If the search division finds when carrying out a supplementary European search that the subsequently filed missing parts under Rule 20.5(d) PCT or, for international applications filed on or after 1 November 2022, correct application documents or parts under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT are not "completely contained" in the priority document, even though the receiving Office did not redate the application, the search opinion must include a warning that the application does not seem to meet the requirements of Rule 20.6 PCT (Rule 82ter.1(c) PCT), a statement of reasons as to why this is the case and an indication that a formal decision on whether to redate the application will be taken by the examining division at a later stage.

Conversely, if the application has been redated by the Receiving Section or the receiving Office, but the search division has reason to believe that it does meet the requirements of Rule 56(3) or Rule 56a(4) (or Rule 20.6 PCT), it must indicate in the search opinion that the examining division may reconsider the decisions of the Receiving Section (or the receiving Office) at a later stage unless it is bound by a decision of the board of appeal.2.2 Applications containing claims filed after the accorded filing date

If the application documents contain any claims filed after the accorded filing date (Rules 40(1), Rule 57(c) and Rule 58), the search division has to examine whether those claims meet the requirements of Art. 123(2), i.e. do not go beyond the technical content of the application documents as they were at the filing date. If it finds that they do not meet the requirements, it will carry out the search as described in B‑VIII, 6.

Where the search opinion and search report are based on late-filed claims but the requirements in Rule 137(4) have not been met (see H‑III, 2.1), a communication asking the applicant to meet these requirements (see H‑III, 2.1.1) cannot be sent yet (i.e. before the search opinion is drawn up) because the examining division is still not responsible for the application (see C‑II, 1). Once it does take charge of the application, it can send this communication, but only if the late-filed claims have not since been superseded (see H‑III, 2.1.1) and only if the application is of one of the types listed in H‑III, 2.1.4.3. Analysis of the application and content of the search opinion

If the search division takes the view that the application and/or the invention do not meet the EPC requirements, then it will raise objections in the search opinion.

As a general rule, the search opinion covers all objections to the application (but see B‑XI, 3.4). These objections can relate to substantive matters (e.g. the subject-matter is not patentable) or to procedural matters (e.g. one or more of the requirements in Rules 41 to 43, and Rule 48 to 50 are not met; see Arts. 1 and 2 of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A113), or even to both.

Where claims relating to a method of treatment of the human or animal body or methods of diagnosis practised on the human or animal body have been searched because it can already be envisaged at this stage that they will be reworded in an allowable format (see B‑VIII, 2), the search opinion will nonetheless object to these claims as relating to subject-matter that is not patentable.

3.9 Positive opinion3.1 The search division's dossier

The search division's first step is to study the description, any drawings and the claims. For this, it will have access to the documents making up the European application and a complete history of the proceedings up to the start of search although the priority documents and any translations may not yet be available at this stage (see B‑XI, 4).

Rule 623.2 Reasoning

3.2.1 Reasoned objections

3.2.2 Positive statements3.2.1 Reasoned objections

For each objection, the search opinion must clearly specify which part of the application is deficient and which EPC requirement is not met, for instance by referring to specific articles or rules. It must also give the reason for the objection where this is not immediately apparent. For example, where a prior-art document is cited but only part of it is relevant, the specific passage relied on should be specified. If the cited prior art shows a lack of novelty or inventive step in the independent claim or claims and there is lack of unity between dependent claims as a result (see F‑V, 7), the applicant is informed of this situation (see H‑IV, 5.2(i)). Substantive matters are normally set out first. The search opinion should be drafted in a way that facilitates later examination of the amended application and, in particular, prevents the need to read it all again in depth (see C‑IV, 2).

In general, all claims are referred to, and all documents cited as "X" or "Y" against certain claims are referred to in the search opinion with a related objection. For dependent claims, it may not always be necessary to give detailed reasoning in the search opinion, but it at least needs to be apparent what the reason for the objection is.3.2.2 Positive statements

Where applicable, the search division also comments positively on patentability in the search opinion. The amount of detail given should be enough to help applicants make their decisions. There is therefore no need to give such detailed reasoning as for an objection, but simply making a positive statement without explaining it will only be enough if the reason behind is anyway immediately apparent.3.3 Comments and amendments in response to the search opinion

The applicant generally has to respond to the search opinion although there are some exceptions (see B‑XI, 8).3.4 Scope of first analysis for generally deficient applications

Where an application is found to be generally deficient, the search division does not analyse it in detail, but sends the applicant a search opinion informing them of its view, mentioning the major deficiencies and saying that, when the application moves on to the examination stage, further examination will be deferred until the application has been amended to overcome them. There are cases where, although a meaningful analysis is possible, a fundamental objection arises, e.g. it is clear that certain claims lack novelty and that the statement of claim will have to be drastically recast, or there are substantial amendments (to an international application entering the European phase – see B‑XI, 2) which are not allowable either because they add new subject-matter that was not in the application as filed (Art. 123(2)) or because they introduce other deficiencies (e.g. the amendment makes the claims unclear – Art. 84). It may then be more appropriate to deal with this objection before making a detailed analysis. For instance, if the claims need to be recast, it may not make sense to object to the clarity of some dependent claims or to a passage in the description which may anyway have to be amended or even deleted in examination proceedings as a result. However, if there are other major objections, these should be addressed. Generally speaking, the search division should try to deal with as many deficiencies as possible in the search opinion to help make the decision-making process in the later examination proceedings as efficient as possible. As regards positive statements on patentability in the search opinion, see B‑XI, 3.2.2.3.5 Contribution to the known art

When analysing the application, the search division concentrates on trying to understand what technical contribution the invention defined in the claims makes to the known art. This should normally be sufficiently clear from the application as filed. If it is not, the search division will raise an objection in the search opinion (see F‑II, 4.5), but only if it is convinced it is necessary, because it might lead the applicant to add subject-matter in breach of Art. 123(2) (see H‑IV, 2 and H‑V).

Rule 42(1)(c)3.6 EPC requirements

Although the search division must bear all the EPC requirements in mind, the ones it is most likely to have to deal with are: sufficiency of disclosure (see F‑III); clarity and support in the description, especially for the independent claims (see F‑IV, 4 and F-IV, 6); novelty (see G‑VI); and inventive step (see G‑VII).3.7 Search division's approach

The search division does not require or suggest amendments simply because it thinks they would improve the wording of the description or claims. It should not take a pedantic approach; what is important is that the meaning of the description and claims is clear. However, any serious inconsistencies between the claims and the description as filed are objected to (see F‑IV, 4.3).3.8 Making suggestions

It is not for the search division to tell applicants to amend their application in a particular way to overcome an objection. It is the applicants' own responsibility to draft their application and they are free to amend it any way they choose as long as the amendment removes the deficiency and is otherwise in keeping with the EPC. However, it can sometimes help if the search division suggests, at least in general terms, an acceptable form of amendment, but it then has to make it clear that the suggestion is merely to help the applicant and that other forms of amendment will still be considered in the examination proceedings. Although not obliged to do so, it will point out amendments which would overcome the objections raised to the applicant if there is a clear way out.

When suggesting an acceptable way of amending the claims, the search division will also invite the applicant to adapt the description to bring it into line with the amended claims (see F‑IV, 4.3).

However, the applicant remains responsible for deciding how to word the application and in particular for defining the subject-matter for which protection is sought (Art. 113(2) EPC).6. The search opinion where the search was limited

Any arguments and objections set out in the search opinion must be consistent with how and why the search was limited. This applies to limitations for reasons of non-patentability (e.g. business methods – Art. 52(2)(c), see B‑VIII, 1), for reasons of severe deficiencies preventing a meaningful search (Rule 63, see B‑VIII, 3) or due to a contravention of Rule 43(2) (Rule 62a, see B‑VIII, 4). In these cases, the search opinion will also contain the information mentioned in B‑VIII, 3.3 and B-VIII, 4.3.

Where claims were not searched because the applicant had not paid the claims fees for them and so they were deemed abandoned (Rule 45 or Rule 162), this will be pointed out to the applicant in the search opinion.7. No search opinion is issued

Where an applicant has filed a request for examination under Rule 70(1) before being sent the search report and has waived the right to a communication under Rule 70(2) (see C‑II, 1(ii)), the examining division becomes responsible for the application as soon as the search report is sent (Art. 18(1) and Rule 10(2)).

If the application is deficient, the examining division will issue a communication under Art. 94(3) in place of the search opinion. If the applicant does not respond to this communication, the application will be considered withdrawn under Art. 94(4) (see C‑III, 4.2).

If the application is ready for grant, the procedure is as follows:

(i)Where the search for conflicting applications under Art. 54(3) was complete, the examining division will issue a communication under Rule 71(3).

(ii)Where the search for conflicting applications under Art. 54(3) was not complete, the applicant will be informed that the application can be granted so long as no state of the art under Art. 54(3) is found during the top-up search (see B‑XI, 3.9). This is purely for information and the applicant does not have to respond.8. Response to the extended European search report (EESR)

Applicants have to respond to the search opinion within the time limit for filing the request for examination under Rule 70(1) (see C‑II, 1 and A‑VI, 2.1).

Rule 70a(1)

However, where applicants filed a request for examination (which under Art. 94(1) means also paying the examination fee) before the search report and the search opinion were transmitted to them, they are sent a communication under Rule 70(2) asking them to confirm that they wish to continue with the application and setting a period for this (see C‑II, 1(i)). They then also have to respond to the search opinion within that period. This is generally what happens for Euro-PCT applications for which a supplementary European search report and search opinion have to be drawn up (see B‑II, 4.3 and E‑IX, 2.5.3), unless the applicant has waived the right to a communication under Rule 70(2) (see C‑II, 1(ii)), in which case the procedure under B‑XI, 7 applies.

Rule 70a(2)

If applicants do not respond to the search opinion in time, their application will be deemed to be withdrawn and they will be notified of this loss of rights accordingly. They can then request further processing in accordance with Art. 121 and Rule 135.

Applicants are not required to respond to the European or supplementary European search report where it was drawn up before 1 April 2010, where it is not accompanied by a search opinion (see B‑XI, 1.1 for applications for which a search opinion is drawn up) or where the search opinion was positive (see B‑XI, 3.9). However, they may still respond to it under Rule 137(2) if they so wish, in which case they are encouraged to do so before the application moves on to the examination stage (see C‑II, 1).

Applicants can respond to the search opinion by filing amended application documents under Rule 137(2) (see C‑II, 3.1) (where amended claims are filed before publication, see A‑VI, 1.3, paragraph 3) or by filing observations on the objections raised, or even by filing both. Such amendments and observations will only be examined by the examining division if the application moves on to the examination stage.

Making a procedural request, e.g. for a consultation or for oral proceedings, or simply disagreeing with the search opinion is not a valid response if done without commenting on any of the objections raised. Where such a request or simple disagreement is the only response received by expiry of the set time limit, the application deemed to be withdrawn under Rule 70a(3). The same applies where a request is filed that cannot be granted at this stage (e.g. for a decision according to the state of the file).

If an applicant does not respond to a search opinion issued for an application for which the search report was drawn up before 1 April 2010 and the application moves on to the examination stage (see C‑II, 1 and C-II, 1.1), the examining division will issue a communication referring to the search opinion and setting a time limit for a response as the first communication under Art. 94(3) (see C‑III, 4). If the applicant does not respond to this communication in time, the application will be deemed to be withdrawn under Art. 94(4).

Where an applicant files amendments in response to the search opinion but not in the way required under Rule 137(4) (see H‑III, 2.1), the examining division may issue a communication under Rule 137(4) (see H‑III, 2.1.1) relating to these amendments, but this can only happen after the examining division has become responsible for the application (see C‑II, 1) and only if the application is one of the types listed in H‑III, 2.1.4.

Rule 70a(3) Rule 112(1)9. Art. 124 and the utilisation scheme

When drafting the search opinion, the search division will consider any prior-art document provided by the applicant under Rule 141(1) or by the office of first filing under Rule 141(2) (see OJ EPO 2011, 62, OJ EPO 2012, 540, OJ EPO 2013, 216, OJ EPO 2015, A2, OJ EPO 2016, A18, OJ EPO 2019, A55, OJ EPO 2019, A38 OJ EPO 2021, A38, and OJ EPO 2019, A39 OJ EPO 2021, A39) if it is already available at the time (see A‑III, 6.12 and B‑IV, 1.3). Requests for information on prior art under Rule 141(3) cannot be made until the application has entered the examination phase (see C‑III, 5).

Art. 124 Rule 141Part C Guidelines for Procedural Aspects of Substantive Examination

ContentsChapter I – Introduction

1. General remark

2. The work of examiners

3. Overview

4. Purpose of examination1. General remark

The term "examiner" as used in this part of the Guidelines is understood to mean the "first" examiner member who, as part of the examining division responsible for deciding whether to grant a patent or refuse an application, is entrusted with substantive examination.

Chapters C‑II to C-IX set out the general procedure for examination and provide guidance on specific matters, where necessary. They do not include detailed instructions on matters of internal administration.

Art. 182. The work of examiners

Under the "Early Certainty from Search" (ECfS) scheme, completing Completing examination files already started is prioritised over beginning work on new files, and grants are expedited once a positive search opinion has been issued.

The attitude of the examiner is very important. Examiners should always strive to be constructive and helpful. While it would of course be quite wrong for them to overlook any major deficiency in an application, they should aim to keep a sense of proportion and not pursue trivial objections. They should bear in mind that, subject to the requirements of the EPC, the drafting of the description and claims of a European patent application is the responsibility of the applicant or their authorised representative.

Examiners should note in particular the instruction in section 4 of the General Part of the Guidelines. This applies not only in relation to other EPO departments. It also means, for example, that the other members of an examining division should not attempt to repeat the work of the first member primary examiner (see C‑VIII, 4).3. Overview

Part C of the Guidelines deals with matters of examination procedure (see C‑II to C-IX).

Matters of substantive law, i.e. the requirements that a European patent application must fulfil, are dealt with in Parts Part F, Part G and Part H.4. Purpose of examination

The purpose of preparing the search opinion (see B‑XI) and of the subsequent examination proceedings is to ensure that the application and the invention to which it relates meet the requirements set out in the relevant articles of the EPC and the rules of its Implementing Regulations. The prime task of the examining division is to deal with the substantive requirements; the criteria by which an examiner judges whether they have been met are dealt with in detail, in so far as appears necessary, in Parts Part F, Part G and Part H. As for the formal requirements (see Part A), these are initially the responsibility of the Receiving Section.

Art. 94(1) Art. 164(1) Rule 62(1)

The examination is to be carried out in accordance with Art. 94(3) and Art. 94(4), Art. 97, Rule 71(1) to Rule 71(7), Rule 71a(1) to Rule 71a(6) and Rule 72. The examiner's first step is to study the description, drawings (if any) and the claims of the application. However, as they will normally have already done this when they carried out the search (see B‑XI, 3), they should concentrate on any amendments and/or comments filed by the applicant in response to the search opinion (see B‑XI, 8). Where the applicant has made amendments without identifying them and/or their basis in the application as filed (see H‑III, 2.1) and the application is one of those mentioned in H‑III, 2.1.4, the examining division may send the applicant a communication under Rule 137(4) requesting this information (see H‑III, 2.1.1).

1. Request for examination

2. Allocation of the application

3. Response filed before first communication in examination

4. Designation fees, extension and validation fees

5. Copy of the search results on the priority or priorities1. Request for examination

For examination of a European patent application to begin, the applicant must file a request for examination and pay the examination fee. The request for examination, which is not deemed filed until after the examination fee's payment, may be filed in the period between the application's filing date and the last day of the six months after the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the European search report's publication (see A‑VI, 2.1). If the request for examination is not filed within this period, the application is deemed withdrawn. However, in such a case, the applicant can file a request for further processing pursuant to Art. 121. The amount of the further processing fee to be paid depends on how many and which of the actions required for a valid request for examination have been omitted (see E‑VIII, 2). According to Rule 70(1), the request for examination may not be withdrawn.

Art. 94 Art. 121 Rule 70 Art. 122(4) Rule 136(3)

Subject to certain exceptions, the applicant must also respond to the search opinion within the above period for filing the request for examination (see B‑XI, 9 and C‑II, 3.1) unless the EPO invites them to confirm an early request for examination according to Rule 70(2), in which case they must respond to the search opinion within the period provided for under Rule 70(2) (see C‑II, 1.1).

Rule 70a(1) and Rule 70a(3)

Responsibility for examining the application passes from the Receiving Section to the examining division when a request for examination is filed. This is subject to two exceptions:

(i)if the applicant files a request for examination before the European search report is sent to them, then the examining division is responsible only from the time when the EPO receives the applicant's response to the invitation to confirm under Rule 70(2)

(ii)if the applicant, having waived the right to receive an invitation to confirm under Rule 70(2) (see C‑VI, 3), files a request for examination before the European search report is sent to them, then the examining division is responsible only from the time when the search report is sent to the applicant.

Rule 10 Rule 70(2)

1.1 Confirmation of the intention to proceed further with the application

1.2 Euro-PCT applications

1.3 Invention to be examined1.1 Confirmation of the intention to proceed further with the application

If the applicant files a request for examination before the search report is sent to them, the EPO will invite them to confirm, within a six-month period, that they wish to proceed with their application. This six-month period is calculated from the mention of the European search report's publication in the European Patent Bulletin. Where the applicant also has to respond to the search opinion, their response is required within this same period (see B‑XI, 8 and C‑II, 3.1). In such a case, the applicant's response to the search opinion is interpreted as the confirmation required by Rule 70(2), even where not explicitly expressed as such. If they fail to confirm their wish to proceed with the application in due time in reply to this invitation, the application will be deemed withdrawn. In this case, however, the means of redress provided for in Art. 121 (further processing of the application) will apply (see A‑VI, 2.3 and E‑VIII, 2). For the conditions applicable to a refund of the examination fee if the application is withdrawn, refused or deemed withdrawn, see A‑VI, 2.5.

Rule 70(2) and Rule 70(3) Art. 121 Art. 11 RFees Rule 70a(2) and Rule 70a(3)1.2 Euro-PCT applications

For applications filed via the PCT route (Euro-PCT application), the six-month period under Rule 70(1) begins with the publication of the PCT search report or the declaration under Art. 17(2)(a) PCT. However, as is laid down in Art. 150(2), the time limit for requesting examination in of a Euro-PCT case application does not expire before the time prescribed in Art. 22 PCT and Art. 39 PCT (i.e. not before the time limit of Rule 159(1)(f)). The time limit will not be affected by whether a supplementary European search pursuant to Art. 153(7) needs to be made or whether the international application is again published by the EPO pursuant to Art. 153(4).

Art. 153(4), Art. 153(6) and Art. 153(7) Art. 150(2) Rule 159(1)(f)

If the request for examination of a Euro-PCT application has not been filed within the time limit, the application is deemed withdrawn under Rule 160(1). In such a case, however, the applicant can file a request for further processing pursuant to Art. 121 (see E‑VIII, 2).

Where the Euro-PCT application is subject to the preparation of a supplementary European search report (see B‑II, 4.3), once this report has been dispatched, a communication under Rule 70(2) is sent to the applicant inviting them to confirm the request for examination within six months of that communication's notification (see E‑IX, 2.5.3).

Art. 121 Rule 136(3) Rule 160(1)1.3 Invention to be examined

Where the search report and the search opinion have been drawn up to cover several inventions lacking unity, the applicant is free to select the invention to be examined in the application under consideration (see also C‑III, 3.2).

The others will be subject to objections of lack of unity and may be divided out according to Rule 36 (see C‑III, 3.3 and C‑IX, 1.3).

Rule 362. Allocation of the application

Dossiers are normally allocated to an examining division that is responsible for examining applications in the technical field in which the particular application was classified by the search division or ISA that carried out the search. It is usual for the first member primary examiner entrusted with the examination of the application in accordance with Art. 18(2) to be the same person who prepared the (supplementary) European search report and search opinion or, where the EPO was the ISA or the authority specified for the supplementary international search, the international search report and WO‑ISA or the supplementary international search report.

There may, however, be instances where it is appropriate to allocate the application to an examining division comprising examiners who are not normally responsible for the indicated part of the International Patent Classification (IPC) and who might not have been involved at the search stage. There are a number of possible reasons for this: e.g. to make it possible, where appropriate, that an original a parent and a divisional application are dealt with by the same examining division (this could sometimes be more efficient, even when the two applications are classified in different technical fields); or if the classification of the published application does not correspond to the subject-matter of the application in the form in which it reaches the substantive examiner (e.g. because the application has been amended after receipt of the search report and search opinion).3. Response filed before first communication in examination

3.1 Response to the search opinion

3.2 Response to PCT actions prepared by the EPO

3.3 The invitation under Rule 70a(1)3.1 Response to the search opinion

Following receipt of the search report and search opinion, and prior to the first communication from the examining division, the applicant must (subject to certain exceptions) respond to the search opinion by filing amendments to the description, claims or drawings and/or filing observations on the objections raised in the search opinion (see B‑XI, 8 for details, in particular as to the exceptions where no reply is required). To avoid delays, care should be taken to comply with the requirements of Rule 137(4) when filing such amendments (see OJ EPO 2009, 533, point 7). Any amendments filed at this stage are made voluntarily by the applicant in accordance with Rule 137(2) (for more details, see C‑III, 2.1).

Rule 137(2) Rule 70(2) Rule 70a

The applicant's response to the search opinion required by Rule 70a (or filed voluntarily in response to search opinions not requiring a response) will be taken into account by the examining division when drafting the first communication. Failure to respond to this communication in due time will result in the application being deemed withdrawn according to Art. 94(4), although this loss of rights is subject to further processing (see E‑VIII, 2). With regard to what constitutes a valid response, see B‑XI, 8.

If the applicant accepts a search division's suggestion regarding an acceptable form of amendment of the claims to overcome the objections raised (see B‑XI, 3.8), they are requested to adapt the description to the claims on file and delete or amend any statements or expressions throwing doubt on the scope of protection (see F‑IV, 4.3).

In exceptional cases, the examining division may decide to issue a summons to oral proceedings as the first action in examination proceedings (see C‑III, 5). In such a case, the applicant's response to the search opinion will be taken into account when drafting the annex to the summons.

If the European search report or supplementary European search report was accompanied by a search opinion but was drawn up before 1 April 2010 (such that a reply to the search opinion was not mandatory, see B‑XI, 8) and the applicant did not reply to it, a communication referring to the search opinion and setting a time limit for reply is issued as the first communication under Art. 94(3). Failure to respond to this communication in due time results in the application being deemed withdrawn according to Art. 94(4).

The procedure explained in the above paragraphs also applies to Euro-PCT applications for which the EPO prepares a supplementary European search report and a search opinion (see B‑II, 4.3 and B‑XI, 1.1).

Art. 94(3) and Art. 94(4) Rule 62(1)3.2 Response to PCT actions prepared by the EPO

For Euro-PCT applications where the EPO acted as the International Searching Authority (ISA) and, where a demand under Art. 31 PCT was filed, also as the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) or the Supplementary International Searching Authority (SISA), the applicant will already have responded to a negative WO‑ISA, IPER or supplementary international search report prepared by the EPO (unless the communication under Rule 161 was issued before 1 April 2010 – see E‑IX, 3.3.3).

This response may comprise amendments and/or observations filed in response to the communication under Rule 161(1) (or possibly filed earlier – see E‑IX, 3.3.1).

If the applicant accepts the search division's suggestion regarding an acceptable form of amendment of the claims to overcome the objections raised (see PCT‑EPO Guidelines, B‑XI, 3.3), they are requested to adapt the description to the claims on file and delete or amend any statements or expressions throwing doubt on the scope of protection (see F‑IV, 4.3).

Any amendments filed at this stage are made voluntarily by the applicant in accordance with Rule 137(2) (for more details see C‑III, 2.2). This response will be taken into account by the examining division when drafting the first communication under Art. 94(3) or, in exceptional cases, the annex to the summons to oral proceedings (C‑III, 5). For more details, see E‑IX, 4.1, E‑IX, 4.2 and E‑IX, 4.3.

Rule 161(1)3.3 The invitation under Rule 70a(1)

Under Rule 70a(1), the applicant is invited to respond to the European search opinion (ESOP) within the period referred to in Rule 70(1) or, where applicable, the period referred to in Rule 70(2) (see B‑XI, 8) unless they have waived their right to receive the communication under Rule 70(2) (see C‑VI, 3).

Where the request for examination (including payment of the examination fee) is filed after the search report has been transmitted to the applicant, the applicant must respond to the ESOP within the period referred to in Rule 70(1). In such cases, the invitation under Rule 70a(1) is sent in a combined communication with the communication under Rule 69(1) (see A‑VI, 2.1). This communication under Rule 70a(1) and Rule 69(1) is issued shortly after the mention of the European search report's publication in the European Patent Bulletin (in general, this is approximately one week later).

Where the request for examination (including payment of the examination fee) is filed before the search report has been transmitted to the applicant, the applicant must respond to the ESOP within the period referred to in Rule 70(2). In such cases, the invitation under Rule 70a(1) is sent in a combined communication with the communication under Rule 70(2). With regard to how the period referred to in Rule 70(2) is calculated for these cases, see C‑II, 1.1 for Euro-direct applications and C‑II, 1.2 for Euro-PCT applications for which a supplementary European search report is prepared.4. Designation fees, extension and validation fees

Under Rule 39(1), the designation fees can be validly paid up to the same time limit as the examination fee and therefore will be generally paid at the same time as the examination fee. The examination of whether and to what extent a designation fee has been validly paid has been entrusted to the formalities officer under Rule 11(3); see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 December 2013, OJ EPO 2014, A6; OJ EPO 2015, A104. The same applies to the examination of whether extension or validation fees have been paid; see A‑III, 12.2.

Rule 39(1) Art. 90(3)5. Copy of the search results on the priority or priorities

If, when the examining division assumes responsibility, the EPO notes that a copy of the results of a search on the claimed priority or priorities as referred to in Rule 141(1) has not been filed by the applicant and is not deemed duly filed under Rule 141(2) (see A‑III, 6.12), it invites the applicant to file, within a period of two months, the copy or a statement that the results of the search referred to in Rule 141(1) are not available to them. This requirement applies to European or Euro-PCT applications filed on or after 1 January 2011 (see OJ EPO 2009, 585). This communication is also sent in cases where the priority in question has since been withdrawn or has lapsed.

Rule 70b(1)

Failure to reply to this invitation in due time results in the application being deemed withdrawn. Further processing is available for this loss of rights (see E‑VIII, 2).

The search results provided by the applicant will be included in the file and will be open to file inspection (see A‑XI).

Rule 70b(2)Chapter III – The first stage of examination

1. Missing parts or elements

2. Amendments made by applicants of their own volition

3. Unity of invention

4. First communication

5. Summons to oral proceedings as the first action in examination

6. Requesting information on prior art (not confined to priority)

7. Evaluation of prior-art documents cited in the search report and late priority claim1. Missing parts or elements

1.1 European patent applications

1.2 Euro-PCT applications – missing elements and parts filed under Rule 20.5 and 20.6 PCT

1.3 Euro-PCT applications – erroneous elements filed under Rule 20.5bis PCT1.1 European patent applications

1.1.1 Application documents filed under Rule 56 or Rule 56a

1.1.2 Claims filed after accordance of a date of filing1.1.1 Application documents filed under Rule 56 or Rule 56a

Where the applicant has supplied missing drawings or parts of the description after the accordance of a filing date (see A‑II, 5) under Rule 56 and the Receiving Section has determined that the missing drawings or parts of the description are "completely contained" in the claimed priority application, the application is not redated to the date on which the missing drawings or parts of the description were supplied. The same applies to correct application documents or parts filed after the accordance of a filing date (see A‑II, 6) under Rule 56a.

The examining division may review the findings of the Receiving Section on the applicability of Rule 56(3) and Rule 56a unless there has been a decision of a board of appeal.

Normally this review will have been initiated at the search stage (see B‑III, 3.3.1 and B‑XI, 2.1). However, it can still be started during substantive examination.

For the criteria for determining whether the "completely contained" requirement of Rule 56(3) and Rule 56a is satisfied, see A‑II, 5.4.2 and A‑II, 6.4.1 respectively.

Should the examining division conclude, contrary to the original finding of the Receiving Section, that the missing elements are not "completely contained" in the priority document, it will raise an objection under Rule 56 or Rule 56a in the first communication under Art. 94(3), presenting detailed arguments as to why the "completely contained" requirement is not satisfied. In addition, it will warn that non-compliance with the requirements of Rule 56(3) or Rule 56a(4) as applicable can result in redating, which in turn can lead to loss of a priority right if the redating causes the filing date to be more than 12 months after the claimed priority date.

Note that if the review was initiated at the search stage and an objection under Rule 56 or Rule 56a was raised in the extended European search report (EESR), the applicant may already have submitted a response to the search opinion (required by Rule 70a or filed voluntarily in response to a search opinion not requiring a response). The examining division will treat this response in the same manner as the reply to the first communication.

If the applicant replies by withdrawing the missing parts or the subsequently filed correct application documents or parts, the examination will continue as normal with the original filing date, but without the missing parts or the correct application documents or parts (see also A‑II, 5.5 and F‑III, 10).

If the applicant succeeds in arguing in their reply that the "completely contained" requirement is satisfied, the examination will continue as normal with the missing parts or the subsequently filed correct application documents or parts, as the case may be, and with the original filing date.

If the applicant maintains the missing parts or the subsequently filed correct application documents or parts and their arguments do not succeed, the examining division will issue a further communication under Art. 94(3) informing them of the application's impending redating to the date on which the EPO received the missing parts or the correct application documents or parts. This communication gives the applicant a further opportunity to withdraw the subsequently filed missing parts or the correct application documents or parts within a time limit of two months (Rule 132(2)) so as to restore the original filing date or to request an appealable decision on the redating. It indicates the reasons why the "completely contained" requirement is not met and also deals with any counter-arguments presented by the applicant.

If the applicant does not reply to the above communication in due time, the application is deemed withdrawn (Art. 94(4)).

If the applicant opts to withdraw the subsequently filed missing parts or the correct application documents or parts, the redating of the application will be deemed not made (see also B‑XI, 2.1). The examiner will continue the examination procedure as normal with the original filing date but without missing parts and/or the correct application documents or parts (see also F‑III, 10).

Rule 56 Rule 56a

If the applicant does not agree with the finding, they may (within two months (Rule 132(2)) request an appealable decision on the matter. In this case, the examining division will issue a reasoned decision informing them of the new filing date, the reasons for the redating and (where appropriate) the detrimental effect of the redating on the claimed priority right. This decision will allow a separate appeal according to Art. 106(2).

Once the period for filing an appeal has expired without an appeal being filed, the examiner will resume examination on the basis of the new filing date. Note that the EESR may contain documents that could become relevant as a result of the redating.

If the applicant files an appeal in due time, the file passes to a board of appeal to review the decision on the filing date's accordance. The examining division will not continue substantive examination while the case is pending before the board. Once the board has issued a decision, the file will be returned to the examining division, which will be bound on this point by the board's decision (Art. 111(2)). It will then resume examination on the basis of the filing date fixed by the board.

Rule 1111.1.2 Claims filed after accordance of a date of filing

If the claims were not present at the application's filing date, the examining division must check whether the subsequently filed claims satisfy the requirements of Art. 123(2). If the basis for these subsequently filed claims in the application as filed has not been indicated by the applicant (see H‑III, 2.1) and the application is one of those mentioned in H‑III, 2.1.4, the examining division may send the applicant a communication under Rule 137(4) requesting this information (see H‑III, 2.1.1).

Art. 123(2)1.2 Euro-PCT applications – missing elements and parts filed under Rule 20.5 and 20.6 PCT

In the case of PCT applications, missing drawings and parts of the description, but also missing claims, may have been filed at the receiving Office for international applications under Rules 20.5 and 20.6 PCT, and its finding can be reviewed in accordance with Rule 82ter.1 PCT. The examining division will review this finding in all cases in which the filing date was retained on the basis of the "completely contained" requirement using the same criteria as applied when assessing compliance with Rule 56(3) (see A‑II, 5.4.2).

If either the EPO acted as the ISA or a supplementary EESR has been issued, this review will normally have been initiated at the search stage (see B‑III, 3.3.1 and B‑XI, 2.1). However, it can still be started during substantive examination. The procedure is the same as for European patent applications (see C‑III, 1.1.1).1.3 Euro-PCT applications – erroneous elements filed under Rule 20.5bis PCT

Rule 20.5bis PCT allows applicants to correct an erroneously filed element (description or claims) or part of the description, claims or drawings (including all drawings) contained in an international application.

Incorporations by reference by the receiving Office under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT, i.e. without changing the filing date, are effective before the EPO as designated or elected Office for international applications filed on or after 1 November 2022. For details, see the notice from the EPO dated 23 June 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A71. On entry into the European phase, the normal procedures apply on the basis that the correct and erroneously filed parts are thus part of the application as filed (see E‑IX, 2).

For international applications filed between 1 July 2020 and 31 October 2022, the provisions under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT remain not fully applicable (see the notice from the EPO dated 14 June 2020, OJ EPO 2020, A81). The EPO adopts the following practice in respect of those applications: corrections accepted by the receiving Office during the international phase under either Rule 20.5bis(b) PCT or Rule 20.5bis(c) PCT – i.e. where it accorded the date of receipt of the correct application documents or a later date as the filing date of the application or shifted the initial filing date of the application to the date of receipt of the correct application documents – will be effective in proceedings before the EPO as designated/elected Office (see OJ EPO 2020, A81).

However, if the receiving Office considered the correct application documents to be incorporated by reference under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT, i.e. without changing the filing date, this incorporation will not be effective in proceedings before the EPO as designated/elected Office. In such cases, the EPO will, on entry into the European phase, consider the filing date of the application to be the date on which the correct application documents were received (Rule 20.8(c) PCT and Rule 20.5bis(b) PCT or Rule 20.5bis(c) PCT). Furthermore, it will consider the application as filed to include the correct application documents but not the erroneously filed ones. The EPO will inform the applicant about this in a communication under Rules 20.8(c) PCT and Rule 82ter.1(c) PCT and Rule 82ter.1(d) PCT, setting a time limit of two months for reply.

(i)If, within the time limit, the applicant requests that the correct application documents be disregarded under Rule 82ter.1(d) PCT, the EPO will issue an interlocutory decision changing the filing date to the date initially accorded by the receiving Office and confirming that the procedure before the EPO as designated/elected Office will be based on the application documents as filed on that date.

(ii)If the applicant files observations with regard to the communication under Rule 20.8(c) PCT and Rule 82ter.1(c) PCT and Rule 82ter.1(d) PCT within the time limit set, the EPO will also issue an interlocutory decision taking into account the observations made.

(iii)If the applicant does not file observations and does not request that the correct application documents be disregarded, an interlocutory decision will not be issued. In this case, the EPO will stick to its findings.

Applicants interested in avoiding this procedure, namely the issuing of the communication under Rules 20.8(c) PCT and Rule 82ter.1(c) PCT and Rule 82ter.1(d) PCT and the setting of a time limit of two months for reply, may make use of the abridged procedure. According to it, they may, within the 31-month time limit under Rule 159(1), at the time of validly requesting early processing or, at the latest, before the communication under Rules 20.8(c) and 82ter.1(c) PCT and Rule 82ter.1(d) PCT is issued:

(a)request that the EPO disregard the correct application documents. In that case, no such communication but an interlocutory decision will be issued. This decision will confirm that the application maintains the initial filing date and that the correct application documents will be disregarded in the procedure before the EPO as designated/elected Office.

(b)confirm that they wish to pursue the application with the filing date corresponding to the date of receipt of the correct application documents and with those correct application documents. In that case, no invitation and no interlocutory decision will be issued. The EPO will correct the filing date and consider the erroneously filed application documents not to have been filed. The applicant will be informed accordingly.

Once the procedure described above has been finalised, a communication under Rules 161 and 162 will be issued and the applicant may amend the application within the scope of the disclosure on the filing date as determined in this procedure.

As a consequence of the procedure described above, it may happen that the application documents as originally filed differ from those forming the basis for the search in the international phase. If the EPO acted as ISA, the examiner has to check carefully whether the invention forming the basis for the European phase was covered by a search in the international phase. If this is not the case, an invitation under Rule 164(2) will be issued (see C‑III, 3.1).

If the subject-matter forming the basis for European phase processing is covered by the international search report, then examination continues as usual but taking into account that the potential change of the filing date might have an impact on intermediary documents cited in the international search report and that the priority might not be valid anymore.

For more details and examples, see OJ EPO 2020, A81.2. Amendments made by applicants of their own volition

Any amendment, including any made by the applicant of their own volition, must satisfy the following conditions:

(i)it must not add subject-matter to the content of the application as filed (see H‑IV, 2.3 and H‑V, 1 to H‑V, 7);

(ii)it must not itself cause the application as amended to be objectionable under the EPC, e.g. the amendment must not introduce a lack of clarity into the claims (Art. 84); and

(iii)it must comply with Rule 137(5) (see H‑IV, 4.1).

If the amendments do not meet these conditions, the applicant should be told that the amended application cannot be allowed. Apart from the amendments referred to in C‑III, 2.1 and C-III, 2.2, which are admissible under Rule 137(2), the applicant may correct obvious errors at any time (see H‑VI, 2.2.1).

If the applicant makes amendments but does not identify them and/or indicate their basis in the application as filed (see H‑III, 2.1) and the application is one of those mentioned in H‑III, 2.1.4, the examining division may send the applicant a communication under Rule 137(4) requesting this information (see H‑III, 2.1.1).

If the applicant accepts a search division's suggestion regarding an acceptable form of amendment of the claims to overcome the objections raised (see B‑XI, 3.8), they are requested to adapt the description to the claims on file and delete or amend any statements or expressions throwing doubt on the scope of protection (see F‑IV, 4.3).

Art. 123(2)

2.1 Amendments made in response to the search opinion

2.2 Amendments made in response to the WO‑ISA, IPER or supplementary international search report2.1 Amendments made in response to the search opinion

The amendments referred to in C‑II, 3.1 are made by the applicant of their own volition (the applicant is required to respond to the search opinion in the EESR but does not necessarily have to respond by filing amendments; they can also respond by filing observations on the search opinion – see B‑XI, 8). This means that the applicant is not restricted to amendments necessary to remedy a defect in the application. Further amendments may be made only with the consent of the examining division (see H‑II, 2.3).

Rule 137(2) and Rule 137(3)2.2 Amendments made in response to the WO‑ISA, IPER or supplementary international search report

For Euro-PCT applications where the EPO acted as ISA or SISA, any amendments filed in response to the communication under Rule 161(1) (see E‑IX, 3.3.4) are made by the applicant of their own volition. This means they may be submitted to overcome objections raised in the WO‑ISA, IPER or supplementary international search report or they may be suggested for some other reason, e.g. to remedy some lack of clarity that the applicant has noted in the original documents. In order to avoid delays, care should be taken to comply with the requirements of Rule 137(4) when filing such amendments. Furthermore, the applicant may also file observations in place of or in addition to amendments.

Rule 137(2)3. Unity of invention

3.1 Searches under Rule 164(2)

3.2 Relation to unity in search; limitation to searched invention

3.3 Excision of other inventions; filing divisional applications

3.4 Refund of additional search fees

3.5 Changing from one searched invention to another3.1 Searches under Rule 164(2)

For Euro-PCT applications where the EPO acted as ISA or as SISA, the examining division under Rule 164(2) assesses the application documents upon expiry of the six-month time limit set in the communication under Rule 161 and Rule 162. For any claimed invention or group of inventions within the meaning of Art. 82 not searched by the EPO in its capacity as ISA or SISA, the examining division issues an invitation to pay search fees.

The application documents as amended may contain claims directed to a non-searched invention in situations other than where the application documents that are to serve as the basis for examination do not meet the requirement of unity of invention.

For instance, the amended application may contain just one invention, but it may be an invention that was claimed but not searched by the EPO as (S)ISA in the international phase. In this case, there is no non-unity objection for this set of claims and the reasoning in the invitation needs only to refer to the non-unity objection in the WO‑ISA and to the fact that no additional fee was paid for this invention during the international phase.

It may well be that an invention in the application documents was not even claimed in the application documents that served as the basis for the procedure in the international phase and has been imported from the description (see F‑V, 7.1(iv)). In such a case, an invitation to pay search fees under Rule 164(2) for any non-searched invention is to be issued by the examining division, irrespective of whether lack of unity persists in the claims. The invitation under Rule 164(2) must state that – and why – this is a new invention not searched in the international phase. If there are other inventions present in the claims that were also not searched (but were claimed in the PCT phase), the applicant must also be invited by way of the same invitation to pay further search fees in respect of those inventions. In assessing whether or not subject-matter present in amended claims constitutes a previously unclaimed invention imported from the description (for which an invitation under Rule 164(2) is to be sent), the principles laid down for assessing compliance with Rule 137(5) (see in H‑IV, 4.1.2) are to be taken into account.

The application documents forming the basis for the European phase may also cover inventions or groups of inventions not searched in the (supplementary) international search report as a result of the procedure for erroneously filed elements under Rule 20.5bis PCT (see C‑III, 1.3). In this case too, an invitation to pay search fees under Rule 164(2) is to be issued by the examining division.

The invitation under Rule 164(2) must be sent before any communication under Art. 94(3). For Rule 164(2) to apply, the claims must be sufficiently clear to allow the identification of a non-searched invention triggering the procedure under Rule 164(2). If the claims are so unclear that a non-searched invention cannot be identified, the first action must be to issue a communication under Art. 94(3) setting out the objections under Art. 84. Should it turn out later in the procedure that amended claims are indeed directed to a non-searched invention, the applicant must file a divisional application for any such subject-matter. Recourse to Rule 164(2) is not provided for if, as a result of further amendments or clarification, (further) non-searched inventions are identified, since the procedure under Rule 164(2) applies to the application documents as submitted by the applicant as the basis for examination.

If auxiliary requests are submitted before a search under Rule 164(2) is performed, only the main request is taken into account for the purpose of the search (notwithstanding the exceptions relating to cases under Rule 62a or Rule 63 where main and auxiliary requests are both considered at the search stage, see B‑VIII, 3.2.2 and B‑VIII, 4.2.2).

If any search fees are paid in due time, the results of the searches are communicated to the applicant as an annex to a communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and Rule 71(2) or under Rule 71(3), as set out in Rule 164(2)(b). This annex is entitled "Search result according to Rule 164(2)".

If the applicant pays the search fees in due time under Rule 164(2) and at the same time files a new set of claims, the search will be carried out and the written opinion issued for the claims on file upon expiry of the period under Rule 161 for which the invitation to pay was sent and the requested fees paid. The amended documents may, however, informally be taken into account by the examiner carrying out the search, where this appears appropriate. Applicants will have the opportunity to file amendments of their own volition after receiving the results of the search under Rule 164(2) annexed to the communication under Art. 94(3) (see H‑II, 2.3).

If search fees are not paid in due time under Rule 164(2), a communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and Rule 71(2) or under Rule 71(3) will be issued and the examining division will require deletion from the claims of any subject-matter that was not searched either because a search fee under Rule 164(2) was not paid (see H‑II, 6) or for a different reason (see H‑IV, 4). Before the patent is granted, this subject-matter should be either deleted from the description and drawings or indicated as not forming part of the claimed invention (see F‑IV, 4.3(iii)).

A communication under Rule 164(2)(b) deals with all objections for each of the inventions searched in accordance with Rule 164(2). For claims relating to inventions already searched by the EPO in the international phase that have been amended but still lack unity, it is sufficient to argue in detail why lack of unity is still present. The communication, where appropriate, further requests the applicant to limit the application to a single searched invention (see Rule 164(2)(c)).

It follows from Rule 164(2)(b) and Rule 164(2)(c) that the special procedure under Rule 164(2) as set out in H‑II, 2.3 ends upon expiry of the time limit set in the communication issued under Rule 164(2)(b). This means that the applicant's right to make amendments of their own volition ends upon expiry of that time limit.

Furthermore, the special procedure as set out in F‑V, 7.1(iv), which exempts amendments from the requirements of Rule 137(5), first sentence, ends upon expiry of the time limit under Rule 161(1). Such amendments will result in an invitation under Rule 164(2)(a) and allow the applicant to obtain a search of unsearched subject-matter referred to in Rule 137(5). However, any amendments submitted after expiry of the time limit under Rule 161(1) are subject to the requirements of Rule 137(5), first sentence (see H‑IV, 4.1.2).

The EPO's obligations under Rule 164(2) are fulfilled and the applicant's rights under this rule are exhausted once a single communication under Rule 164(2) has been sent. It follows that in cases of cascading non-unity no (further) invitation under Rule 164(2) is sent. The same applies if, during the examination procedure, claims are added or existing claims amended so that they relate to non-searched inventions.

Exceptional cases may arise where the following sequence of events has occurred in the international phase:

(i)The EPO acted as ISA in the international phase

(ii)The EPO acting as ISA invited the applicant to pay one or more additional international search fees in accordance with Art. 17(3)(a) PCT and Rule 40 PCT (due to a lack of unity according to Rule 13 PCT)

(iii)The applicant paid at least one such additional search fee

(iv)The additional search or searches led to a further objection as to a lack of unity a posteriori (a cascading lack of unity), resulting in one of the inventions identified in the invitation under Art. 17(3)(a) PCT and Rule 40 PCT being further subdivided and resulting in sub-inventions not originally identified in that invitation

(v)The EPO did not search all such sub-inventions.

In the above case, the EPO will invite the applicant to pay search fees for any such unsearched sub-inventions in the claims that are to form the basis for examination on expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161(1), in accordance with Rule 164(2).

Where the EPO acted as SISA in accordance with Rule 45bis.9 PCT, it may make a finding of a lack of unity of the international application according to Rule 45bis.6(a) PCT. However, in the procedure before the SISA, the applicant cannot pay additional supplementary international search fees, and the supplementary international search report will be directed only to the invention or unitary group of inventions first mentioned in the claims (Rule 45bis.6(a) PCT). Where such an application contains unsearched inventions in the claims that are to form the basis for examination on expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161(1), a communication under Rule 164(2) is issued allowing the applicant to have these inventions searched upon payment of search fees and to pursue one of them in the examination proceedings.

Rule 164(2)(b) provides for a right to amend the application in response to the results of any search under Rule 164(2). This means that applicants may make amendments of their own volition once in response to the communication under Art. 94(3) to which the search results under Rule 164(2) are annexed (H‑II, 2.3).

Rule 164(2)3.2 Relation to unity in search; limitation to searched invention

An objection of lack of unity of invention, if applicable, should already have been raised at the search stage. If such an objection was not raised, but the examining division nevertheless considers that the requirements of Art. 82 are clearly not met, the question of lack of unity will be addressed as early as possible during examination (see F‑V, 7.1 and H‑II, 6.3).

When raising a finding of lack of unity or upholding an earlier one objected to by the applicant on the basis of unconvincing reasons, the examining division will invite the applicant to limit the application to one invention or group of inventions. In response to such an invitation, applicants must clearly indicate which searched invention they wish to prosecute further. If the response is unclear, the examining division must seek clarification before continuing with the examination (see T 736/14).

Art. 82

3.2.1 No additional search fees paid

3.2.2 Additional search fees paid

3.2.3 Invitation to pay additional search fees combined with invitation to restrict the scope of the search3.2.1 No additional search fees paid

If applicants have not availed themselves of the opportunity to have the search results on the other inventions included in the search report because they have paid no additional search fees in response to the invitation under Rule 64(1) (see B‑VII, 1.2) or Rule 164(1) (see B‑VII, 2.3), they will be assumed to have elected to proceed with the application on the basis of the searched invention (see G 2/92). In cases where a communication under Rule 164(2) has been sent (see C‑III, 3.1), Rule 164(2)(c) requires the applicant to delete all unsearched inventions from the claims.

Final responsibility for establishing whether the application meets the requirement of unity of invention ultimately rests with the examining division (see T 631/97). When considering the issue of unity, the examining division will consider both the reasons given in the search opinion and the applicant's response (see B‑XI, 8 for details of when a response to the search opinion is required); for Euro-PCT applications where no supplementary European search report is prepared, the examining division will consider the reasons given in the WO‑ISA, IPER or supplementary international search report prepared by the EPO and the applicant's response as required by Rule 161(1) (see E‑IX, 3.2). In the absence of any convincing response from the applicant to the issue of unity as raised earlier, the examining division will normally initially uphold the position taken earlier (see B‑XI, 1.2) and will then require deletion of all the inventions other than that which has been searched. If the examining division is convinced, e.g. by arguments from the applicant, that the opinion on unity at the search stage was incorrect, then an additional search is performed for that part of the subject-matter that is judged to be unitary with an invention that was searched (see B‑II, 4.2(iii) and C‑IV, 7.3) and the examination is carried out on those claims that comply with the requirement of unity of invention. The applicant may file a divisional application for any excised subject-matter (see C‑III, 3.3).

Rule 64 Rule 164(1) and Rule 164(2)3.2.2 Additional search fees paid

If the applicant has taken the opportunity to have other inventions searched, they may decide that the application is to proceed on the basis of one of these inventions and to delete the others. If the applicant has not yet done so and if the examining division maintains the objection of lack of unity (see C‑III, 3.2), it should invite the applicant at the beginning of substantive examination to state which invention the prosecution of the application should be based on and to limit the application accordingly by excising those parts belonging to the other inventions. For the latter inventions, the applicant may file divisional applications (see C‑III, 3.3).3.2.3 Invitation to pay additional search fees combined with invitation to restrict the scope of the search

In exceptional cases, an invitation to pay additional search fees under Rule 64(1), Rule 164(1) or Rule 164(2) may be combined with an invitation to restrict the scope of the search under Rule 62a(1) and/or Rule 63(1).

When the application enters the examination phase or, in the case of Rule 164(2), after the reply to the first communication, the examiner will check whether the claims on which substantive examination is based meet the requirement of unity of invention (Art. 82) and cover only subject-matter that has been searched. If the claims lack unity of invention, the applicant will be invited to limit the claims to one searched invention and to exclude all unsearched subject-matter from the scope of the claims. If, in reply to the objection raised by the examiner, the applicant fails to respond adequately (either by amending the claims or by submitting convincing arguments) and the non-unity objection can be maintained, the application may be refused under Art. 97(2) in conjunction with Art. 82 (see H‑II, 6.3 and H-II, 6.4), provided that the right to be heard, which includes the right to oral proceedings if so requested (Art. 116(1)), has been respected.

If the original set of claims has been amended before entering the examination phase or, in the case of Rule 164(2), in reply to the first communication such as to meet the requirements of Art. 82 but includes subject-matter that was excluded from the search following an invitation under Rule 62a(1) and/or Rule 63(1), the examiner will either (i) invite the applicant to limit the set of claims to the searched subject-matter under Rule 62a(2) and/or Rule 63(3) or (ii) raise an objection under Rule 137(5) against the claims concerned (see H‑IV, 4.1.2). In cases under Rule 164(2), if the first communication already included the relevant objections/invitations and the right to be heard has been respected, the application may be refused.

If, in reply to the invitation under Rule 62a(2) or Rule 63(3), the applicant fails to respond adequately (either by amending the claims or by submitting convincing arguments), the application may be refused under Art. 97(2), provided that the right to be heard has been respected (see F‑IV, 3.3).3.3 Excision of other inventions; filing divisional applications

The applicant may file divisional applications for inventions deleted in accordance with C‑III, 3.2.1 or C-III, 3.2.2.

A divisional application may only be filed if the application being divided is still pending (see A‑IV, 1.1.1).

Rule 363.4 Refund of additional search fees

If the applicant has paid further search fees in response to an invitation under Rule 64(1), Rule 164(1) or Rule 164(2) and has requested a refund, the examining division is required to review the validity of the finding of lack of unity (see also F‑V, 4 to F‑V, 7).

A refund request should be handled promptly. If the examiner concludes that it should not be granted, the applicant is informed of the examining division's preliminary opinion in a communication under Art. 94(3). This preliminary opinion takes into account the arguments put forward by the applicant in their reply to the search opinion. The applicant is informed that they may request an interlocutory decision on the refund, allowing a separate appeal under Art. 106(2). If there is a pending request for oral proceedings, the applicant is also invited in the communication to clarify whether this request also applies to the issuing of the interlocutory decision on the request for refund. If the applicant confirms this to be the case, oral proceedings will have to be held before a negative decision on the request for refund can be issued.

an An interlocutory decision to that effect should be issued at the earliest opportunity, subject to the requirements of Art. 113(1), and not left until the final decision on the application. Of course, if the stage in the procedure when the examiner is in a position to issue the decision on the refund coincides with the issuing of either a Rule 71(3) communication or a decision refusing the application, then, in the former case, the interlocutory decision can be issued with the Rule 71(3) communication; in the latter case, the decision on the refund can be included in the decision refusing the application. The examiner ensures that the interlocutory decision issued on this matter clearly states that a separate appeal under Art. 106(2) is allowed.

Before an interlocutory decision is issued which refuses the request to refund additional search fees under Rule 64(2), applicants should be informed of the examining division's preliminary opinion in a communication under Art. 94(3). The arguments presented by the applicants in their reply to the search opinion should be taken into account in this preliminary opinion. Furthermore, a time limit should be set in order to give the applicants the possibility to comment on the examining division's preliminary opinion. At the same time, the applicants can be informed that they may request an interlocutory decision on the refund which will allow separate appeal under Art. 106(2). If these requirements are fulfilled, the applicant's right to be heard under Art. 113(1) is respected. The same procedure applies to the refund of search fees paid under Rule 164(1) and Rule 164(2).

Rule 164(5) provides for a refund of any search fee paid under Rule 164(1) or Rule 164(2) in line with Rule 64(2) (see A‑X, 10.2.2). Where the applicant pays a search fee in response to the Rule 164(2) invitation and at the same contests the basis for requiring payment of a search fee and requests its refund under Rule 164(5), the examining division may deal directly with this issue in the communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) or Rule 71(2) that accompanies the search results under Rule 164(2). Such an immediate review of the applicant's request is not possible in cases under Rules 64(1) and Rule 164(1) until the examining division assumes responsibility for the application.

The review under Rule 64(2) or Rule 164(5) is restricted to a reconsideration of the validity of the original finding under the circumstances existing at the time the Rule 64(1), Rule 164(1) or Rule 164(2) invitation was sent, taking into account only the prior art that was available at that time. For more details on the assessment of unity of invention, see F‑V.

The issue of refunds of additional international search fees paid to the EPO acting as ISA in response to an invitation under Art. 17(3)(a) PCT, however, does not arise in the European phase because these fees were paid in the international phase, which is closed by this stage of the procedure. The applicant may contest the payment of additional international search fees to the EPO acting as ISA by paying these under protest according to Rule 40.2(c) PCT. However, this must be done in the international phase (see also the decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 June 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A59, and the notice from the EPO dated 24 March 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 322).

Rule 64(2) Rule 164(5)3.5 Changing from one searched invention to another

Once the applicant has limited the claims to one searched invention, the examining division will refuse to admit amendments involving switching to a different searched invention (for further information, see H‑II, 6.1).4. First communication

If deficiencies persist in the application even after the applicant has filed their response to the search opinion, the examining division will issue a communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1), Rule 71(2) in subsequent examination proceedings and will consider the applicant's reply before issuing a negative decision or a summons to oral proceedings. For the exceptional case where a summons to oral proceedings is issued as the first action in examination proceedings, see C‑III, 5.

When drawing up such a communication (or exceptionally the summons to oral proceedings), the examining division will take into account the documents (if any) cited in the search report and any further documents found as a result of the search referred to in C‑IV, 7.1 as well as any amendments proposed or comments made by the applicant in reply to the search opinion (see B‑XI, 8) or the Rule 161(1) communication (see E‑IX, 3). The examiner should identify in this communication any EPC requirements that, in their opinion, the application does not satisfy. The communication will give reasons for any objections raised and invite the applicant within a specified period to file observations or submit amendments. The filed application documents are not sent back to the applicant although a copy of the description and claims may be sent in appropriate cases (see H‑III, 2). The examiner will re-examine the application once the applicant has replied.

If no search opinion has been issued (see C‑VI, 3, F‑V, 7.1(ii) and B‑XI, 1.1), the examiner's first communication under Art. 94(3) will, as a general rule (see B‑XI, 3) and by analogy with the search opinion, cover all objections to the application (see B‑XI, 3.4 for exceptional cases where not all objections are raised). A summons will not be issued as the first office action in examination proceedings in such a case.

Rule 71(1) and Rule 71(2) Rule 132 Art. 94(3)

4.1 Reasoning

4.2 Invitation to file comments and amendments4.1 Reasoning

4.1.1 Reasoned objections

4.1.2 Positive statements/suggestions4.1.1 Reasoned objections

As with the search opinion, for each objection, the communication should indicate the part of the application that is deficient and the EPC requirement not met, either by referring to specific articles or rules or by other clear indication; it should also give the reason for any objection where not immediately apparent (for more details see B‑XI, 3.2).

The burden of proof and the onus to present the relevant facts about patentability requirements lie initially with the examining division, which must provide evidence and facts to support its objection (see T 655/13). Accordingly, prior-art documents forming the basis for novelty or inventive step objections must be cited in such a way that these conclusions can be checked without difficulty (see E‑X, 2.6).

Rule 71(2)4.1.2 Positive statements/suggestions

Where appropriate, the communication should also contain positive statements on patentability where some of the claims meet the patentability requirements (see B‑XI, 3.2.2). In this phase of the proceedings, the examiner should make such statements in particular where the claims for which a positive conclusion is reached have not yet been commented on.

Concerning making suggestions on how to overcome objections, see B‑XI, 3.8. When suggesting an acceptable form of amendment to the claims, the examining division will also invite the applicant to adapt the description to bring it into line with the amended claims (see F‑IV, 4.3).4.2 Invitation to file comments and amendments

The communication should include an invitation to the applicant to file observations, correct any deficiencies and, if necessary, submit amendments to the description, claims and drawings. It must also state the period within which the applicant must reply. Failure to reply in due time will cause the application to be deemed withdrawn (see C‑VI, 1 and E‑VIII, 1). Further processing is available for this loss of rights (E‑VIII, 2).

Rule 71(1) and Rule 71(2) Art. 94(3) and Art. 94(4)5. Summons to oral proceedings as the first action in examination

In exceptional cases, the examining division may decide to issue a summons to oral proceedings as the first action in examination. It may do so only if:

– in its opinion, there is no prospect of a grant, even taking into account the applicant's reply to the search opinion

– the content of the claims on file is not different in substance from that of the claims that served as a basis for the search

– one or more of the objections raised in the search opinion and crucial to the outcome of the examination procedure still apply.

In addition, in examination of a divisional application, the examining division may exceptionally issue a summons to oral proceedings as the first action if:

– the parent application was refused or withdrawn and there is no prospect of a grant for the divisional application, even taking into account the applicant's reply to the search opinion

– the content of the claims on file is substantially the same as or broader than the subject-matter of claims that were examined for the refused or withdrawn parent application or that served as a basis for the search of the divisional application

– one or more of the objections that are crucial to the outcome of the examination procedure and that were raised in either the search opinion established for the divisional application, the parent's refusal or a communication issued for the withdrawn parent still apply.

The annex to the summons issued as the first action in examination must deal with the applicant's requests in their entirety and be as detailed as a communication under Art. 94(3) (see, in particular, C‑III, 4.1). It must not include any new objections or cite new documents that were neither included in the search opinion nor, in the case of a divisional application, in the refusal of the parent application or in a communication issued for the withdrawn parent application. All objections to the application must be covered and substantiated by giving the essential legal and factual reasons. In addition, it must include the reasons for the decision to directly summon to oral proceedings as the first action in examination. The division may inform the applicant in a telephone call if it is considering issuing a summons to oral proceedings as the first action in examination (C‑VII, 2.5).

In order to allow the applicant sufficient time to prepare any submissions ahead of the oral proceedings, the summons should be issued with at least six months' notice.

In accordance with the principles applicable to the summons to oral proceedings, applicants may avail themselves of the possibility to submit any arguments and amendments by expiry of the deadline set under Rule 116(1). Requests filed after the date set under Rule 116(1) are not to be treated as late-filed (H‑II, 2.7) in the case of a summons to oral proceedings issued as first action in examination.

Should the applicant's submissions contain a genuine effort to overcome the examining division's objections, oral proceedings may be cancelled or postponed. Otherwise, a decision on the substance of the application will in principle be taken during the oral proceedings, even if the applicant does not attend them (see E‑III, 6 and E‑III, 8.3.3.3).6. Requesting information on prior art (not confined to priority)

The EPO may invite the applicant to submit, within a period of two months, information on prior art taken into consideration in national or regional patent proceedings and concerning an invention to which the European patent application relates. This in particular encompasses search results with respect to applications for patents or utility models whose priority is not being claimed. The EPO may by the same means request the copy of the search results on the priority or priorities referred to in Rule 141(1), where those results were not available to the applicant when requested under Rule 70b(1) (see the notice from the EPO dated 28 July 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 410). Failure by the applicant to comply with this invitation results in the application being deemed withdrawn under Art. 124(2). Further processing is available for this loss of rights (see E‑VIII, 2).

Given the considerable work such invitations can entail for applicants, further requests under Rule 141(3) will be issued only in individual cases where there are cogent reasons to suspect the existence of additional, relevant prior art.

This invitation is an independent communication and the above-mentioned time limit is non-extendable. The invitation can be sent by itself or at the same time as an Art. 94(3) communication. If sent at the same time, the time limits set in both communications are independent of one another. Any information on prior art provided by the applicant will be included in the file and will be open to file inspection (see A‑XI).

Art. 124 Rule 141(3)7. Evaluation of prior-art documents cited in the search report and late priority claim

As explained in A‑III, 6.5.1 and A‑III, 6.5.2, the applicant has the right to correct or introduce a priority claim within 16 months of the earliest priority (with a minimum of four months from the European filing date in the case of corrections). If this happens before finalisation of the search report, the examiner may review the draft search report to take into account the change in the application's effective date. In cases where the search report was issued on the basis of the original priority status (i.e. addition or correction of a priority claim is effected after the search report is drawn up), the examiner at the substantive examination stage should reevaluate the relevance of the documents cited in the search report. Where it appears that the prior art available to the examiner is unlikely to reflect the state of the art in a sufficiently complete way for the purpose of a patentability assessment, the examiner should then conduct an additional search (see C‑IV, 7.3). No further search report will be issued in these cases: the applicant will be informed of any newly found documents in a communication under Art. 94(3) (with copies of such documents annexed to that communication).Chapter IV – Examination of replies and further stages of examination

1. General procedure

2. Extent of examination of replies

3. Further action upon examination of replies

4. Later stages of examination

5. Examination of amendments

6. Admissibility of amendments made by the applicant

7. Search-related issues in examination

8. New submissions in reply to a summons1. General procedure

Following the applicant's reply to the search opinion (see B‑XI, 8), WO‑ISA, IPER or supplementary international search report prepared by the EPO (see E‑IX, 3) or to the first communication, the examiner must examine the application, taking into account observations or amendments made by the applicant.

Where the application is one of those mentioned in H‑III, 2.1.4, Rule 137(4) requires that any amendments made by the applicant in reply to the search opinion, WO‑ISA, IPER or supplementary international search report be identified and their basis in the application as filed indicated. Failure to do so may result in the examining division sending a communication under Rule 137(4). For more details of the procedure, see H‑III, 2.1.1 and H-III, 2.1.2.

In the case of one or more auxiliary requests directed to alternative texts for grant of a patent, every such request qualifies as a text submitted or agreed by the applicant within the meaning of Art. 113(2) and therefore must be dealt with in the order indicated or agreed to by the applicant, up to and including the highest-ranking allowable request, if any (see also H‑III, 3 and C‑V, 1.1). For the types of application mentioned in H‑III, 2.1.4, Rule 137(4) must also be complied with in respect of auxiliary requests, which may also be subject to a communication under Rule 137(4).2. Extent of examination of replies

After the first examination stage, provided that the:

– search opinion

– WO‑ISA (when prepared by the EPO)

– explanation accompanying the supplementary international search report under Rule 45bis.7(e) PCT (when prepared by the EPO, see the notice from the EPO dated 24 March 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 316, point 6)

– IPER (when prepared by the EPO)

– first communication (see B‑XI, 1.1 and B-XI, 8)

was comprehensive and clear (see B‑XI, 3 and C‑III, 4 and C-III, 4.1), the examiner will not normally need to completely re-read the application but rather should concentrate on the amendments themselves, the related passages and the deficiencies previously noted.3. Further action upon examination of replies

Examiners should be guided at this stage by the overriding principle that a final position (grant or refusal) should be reached in as few actions as possible, and should conduct the procedure with this always in mind. The EPC provides that the process of communicating with the applicant described in C‑III, 4 is repeated "as often as necessary".

In most cases, the applicant will have tried to deal with all the examiner's objections. A letter of reply from the applicant does not have to be substantively complete or cogent to qualify as a reply within the meaning of Art. 94(4). For the application not to be deemed withdrawn, it is enough for the applicant to comment on, even incompletely, or to file amendments in reply to at least one of the objections raised in the Art. 94(3) communication. In contrast, purely formal requests, such as for extension of the time limit under Art. 94(3) or for a consultation, do not qualify as replies under Art. 94(4) (see also B‑XI, 8 and E‑VIII, 2). A request for a decision according to the state of the file (see C‑V, 15), however, qualifies as a reply within the meaning of Art. 94(4).

If the only outstanding objection is the need to amend the description, see C‑VI, 1.1.

Art. 94(3)

If examination of the applicant's reply shows that despite their submissions objections persist, and provided that at least one communication has been sent in examination proceedings (see C‑III, 4 and E‑IX, 4.1) and the applicant has been given the right to be heard (Art. 113(1)), i.e. the decision is based solely on grounds they have had an opportunity to comment on, the examiner will consider recommending to the other members of the examining division that the application be refused (see T 201/98). However, where there is a reasonable prospect that an additional invitation to overcome the objections could lead to a grant, the examiner will send a further written communication or contact the applicant by telephone. The examiner may also make suggestions on how to overcome the raised objections (see B‑XI, 3.8 and C‑III, 4.1.2).

If examination of the applicant's reply shows that they have not dealt with all the main objections in their reply, it may be appropriate to draw the deficiencies to their attention, e.g. by telephone. But if no positive reaction is to be expected, the examiner should consider recommending to the other members of the examining division that the application be refused immediately (again provided that at least one communication has been sent in examination proceedings).

If substantial differences of opinion exist, the issues are generally best dealt with in writing. If, however, there seems to be confusion about points in dispute, e.g. the applicant seems to have misunderstood the examiner's arguments or the applicant's own arguments are unclear, then a consultation may be useful. A consultation may also expedite the procedure if the matters to be resolved are minor. Consultations do not constitute oral proceedings (see E‑III) and are more fully considered in C‑VII, 2.

Art. 113(1)

3.1 Further action where a request for a translation of the priority application was sent earlier in examination proceedings3.1 Further action where a request for a translation of the priority application was sent earlier in examination proceedings

In cases where an invitation under Rule 53(3) to file a translation of one or more priority applications was sent earlier in examination proceedings (either separately or at the same time as an Art. 94(3) communication – see A‑III, 6.8.2), a subsequent communication (under Art. 94(3) or Rule 71(3) or a summons to oral proceedings) cannot be sent until the translation is filed or the period for further processing has expired (see also C‑VIII, 5.1 E‑III, 5.1). This also applies in cases where the Rule 53(3) invitation was sent at the same time as a previous Art. 94(3) communication and the applicant has already replied to that communication (e.g. by filing amendments) but not yet provided the translation and the original time limit or the period for further processing is still running.

Rule 53(3)4. Later stages of examination

The considerations explained in C‑IV, 3 also apply to later stages of examination given that, having regard to the principle stated in C‑IV, 3, the greater the number of actions performed, the more likely it is that the most appropriate course of action is to refer the application to the other members of the examining division for a decision. Where this decision is to refuse the application, particular care should be taken to ensure that the decision does not offend against Art. 113(1).5. Examination of amendments

Amendments must satisfy the conditions listed in C‑III, 2. When they were effected must also be established.6. Admissibility of amendments made by the applicant

For matters relating to the admissibility of amendments made in examination proceedings, see H‑II, 2.

Rule 137(2) and Rule 137(3)7. Search-related issues in examination

7.1 Search for conflicting European patent applications

7.2 National prior rights

7.3 Additional searches during examination

7.4 Search at the examination stage

7.5 Citing documents not mentioned in the search report7.1 Search for conflicting European patent applications

The examiner should make a search for any additional conflicting European patent applications falling within the area defined by Art. 54(3) unless this was already covered by the search report.

This is because, in general, the search files will not be complete in respect of such material at the time of the main search. Since priority dates claimed (if any) may not be accorded to all or part of the application but may be accorded to the appropriate part of a conflicting application (see F‑VI, 2.1), this search should be extended to cover all European patent applications published up to eighteen months after the filing of the application under consideration.

If the examiner is unable to complete this top-up search when preparing the search opinion or the first communication under Art. 94(3), they should ensure that it is completed before the application is reported to be in order for the grant of a patent. In the rare cases where the application is found to be in order before this search can be completed (e.g. due to a request for accelerated prosecution of an application not claiming priority, "PACE", see the notice from the EPO dated 30 November 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A93), the grant of a patent should be postponed until the top-up search can be completed.

If the top-up search is performed at the earliest 18 months from the filing date of the application under examination, the priority situation needs to be checked only if intermediate documents and/or conflicting applications are retrieved.

The top-up search may exceptionally be performed at the earliest 18 months after the priority date on On condition that the priority claim is valid for the whole content of the patent application under examination, the top-up search may exceptionally be performed at the earliest 18 months from the priority date. If examiners are unable to complete this "topping-up" search at the time the search opinion or the first communication under Art. 94(3) is prepared, they should ensure that such search is completed before the application is reported to be in order for the grant of a patent. In the rare case in which the application is found to be in order before this search can be completed (e.g. due to a request for accelerated prosecution of an application not claiming priority, "PACE", see the notice from the EPO dated 4 May 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 352), the grant of a patent should be postponed until the topping-up search can be completed (T 1849/12).

In addition to retrieving Art. 54(3) documents not available at the time of the original search, the top-up search takes into consideration potentially relevant prior art cited by other patent offices on applications belonging to the same patent family as the application under examination at the EPO and therefore needs to be performed for any file at the start and end of examination.

The examiner may retrieve relevant intermediate and/or conflicting Euro-PCT applications for which it is not yet clear if they will become prior art under Art. 54(3) alone or in conjunction with Rule 165 (see G‑IV, 5.2). In these cases, the examining division cannot issue an intention to grant before it can be established if these documents are prior art under Art. 54(3). The examiner will first check if the Euro-PCT application has entered the European phase at 31 months after the earliest priority date of the application. If not, it may still constitute conflicting prior art under Art. 54(3) if the PCT applicant has paid the required filing fee under Rule 159(1)(c) and has supplied the PCT application in any official EPO language. The examiner will then verify if the application has become prior art under Art. 54(3) in conjunction with Rule 165. Since August 2021, the EPO publishes these cases in section I.2(2) of the European Patent Bulletin under the heading "International applications considered as comprised in the state of the art under Rule 165 and Art. 54(3) EPC".

For the refund of examination fees (see A‑VI, 2.5), the launch of a top-up search is triggered at the start of examination. This creates a marker that serves as evidence in the file that the examining division has started its substantive work.7.2 National prior rights

In view of the importance of national prior rights (see B‑VI, 4.2) for applicants in proceedings before the Unified Patent Court, the examiner expands the top-up search scope at the grant stage (see C‑IV, 7.1) to include national applications and patents of all the contracting states in so far as they are present in the EPO's databases.

The division informs the applicant about the outcome of the top-up search for national prior rights. Those that appear prima facie relevant for the application are communicated to the applicant.7.3 Additional searches during examination

An additional search will sometimes be required either at the first stage of amendment or subsequently. This may arise for a number of reasons.

An additional search may be necessary:

(i)where a partial search taking the place of the search report under Rule 63 has been issued at the search stage after an invitation under Rule 63(1) (see B‑VIII, 3, B-VIII, 3.1 and B-VIII, 3.2) and the deficiencies rendering a meaningful search impossible under Rule 63 have been subsequently corrected by amendment complying with Rule 137(5) (see H‑IV, 4.1.1) or successfully refuted by the applicant

(ii)where a declaration that a meaningful search was not possible took the place of the search report under Rule 63 and the applicant successfully refuted the objections

(iii)where the applicant successfully argues that a plurality of independent claims in the same category, which led to a limitation of the search report in accordance with Rule 62a (see B‑VIII, 4.1 and B-VIII, 4.2), is in fact allowable according to the exceptions provided for in Rule 43(2) (see F‑IV, 3.2)

(iv)where a particular part of the application has not been searched because of an objection of lack of unity of invention and the arguments advanced by the applicant have convinced the examining division that unity is given

(v)where the claims have been so amended that their scope is no longer covered by the original search

(vi)where a search report under Rule 61 was issued containing no prior-art documents because the technical features were considered notorious (see B‑VIII, 2.2.1) and the examining division does not share this opinion

(vii)where no prior-art document was cited for features that were considered part of the common general knowledge and the examining division does not share this opinion or the common general knowledge is challenged by the applicant (see G‑VII, 2 and G-VII, 3.1)

(viii)exceptionally, where the applicant states that a mistake was made in the acknowledgement of prior art (see G‑VII, 5.1) or the examiner believes that material relevant to obviousness might be found in technical fields not taken into account during the search

(ix)where the applicant has introduced a new priority claim after the filing date (see C‑III, 6).

If the application was filed under the PCT, the search report will be the international search report issued under the PCT and will be accompanied by a supplementary European search report unless the Administrative Council decides that that is to be dispensed with (see E‑IX, 3.2). Both of these reports will have to be considered by the examiner when deciding whether any additional search is required.

In the case of a Euro-PCT application for which the EPO acting as ISA or SISA issued an incomplete search report or a declaration of no search (see PCT‑EPO Guidelines, B‑VIII, 1), an additional search may be necessary if the deficiencies underlying the limitation of the search have been corrected by amendment or successfully refuted by the applicant (see B‑II, 4.2 (ii)). Otherwise, the examining division will object to claims relating to subject-matter not searched by the EPO acting as ISA, referring to the EPC provision invoked for the limitation of the search, e.g. Art. 84. Rule 137(5), second sentence, cannot be invoked in that context.

For searches under Rule 164(2), see C‑III, 3.1.

Art. 153(6) and Art. 153(7)7.4 Search at the examination stage

Although all search work (other than for Art. 54(3) material) should as a rule be done at the search stage, in exceptional circumstances examiners are not barred from looking for a relevant document whose existence they know of or have reason to suspect, provided they can retrieve that document in a short time.7.5 Citing documents not mentioned in the search report

A copy of any document cited by the examiner but not mentioned in the search report, for example one found in a search under C‑IV, 7.1, C‑IV, 7.2 or C‑IV, 7.3, should be sent to the applicant and identified in the electronic dossier (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, J.2).8. New submissions in reply to a summons

New requests filed in reply to a summons to oral proceedings will normally be discussed at the oral proceedings. As a rule, there is no provision for detailed discussion before the oral proceedings.

However, informal consultation to discuss the new requests may be allowed by the first member examiner (see C‑VII, 2), in particular if there is a reasonable prospect that the consultation could lead to an agreed allowable claim set.

The examining division strives to review newly filed requests in good time before oral proceedings so the proceedings can be cancelled if necessary, in particular where a newly filed main request is considered patentable.

For cases where the newly filed main request is not considered patentable but one of the auxiliary requests is, see E‑X, 2.9.Chapter V – The final stage of examination

1.1 Text for approval

1.2 Grant and publishing fee

1.3 Translations of the claims

1.4 Claims fees due in response to Rule 71(3) communication

1.5 Other information in the communication under Rule 71(3)1.1 Text for approval

Once the examining division decides that a patent can be granted, it must inform the applicant of the text it intends to use for the grant. This text may include amendments and corrections that the examining division made on its own initiative and can reasonably expect the applicant to accept. If in doubt as to whether the applicant will agree to the proposed amendments, the examining division should contact them by telephone or via an official communication. The applicant's agreement to such amendments during a consultation will usually be recorded in the communication under Rule 71(3) (see C‑VII, 2.4).

Examples of amendments not requiring consultation with the applicant:

(a)amendment of a statement of invention in the description to bring it into conformity with the claims

(b)deletion of vague general statements in the description (see F‑IV, 4.4) or of obviously irrelevant matter (see F‑II, 7.4)

(c)insertion of values in SI units (see F‑II, 4.13)

(d)insertion of reference numerals in claims unless the applicant is known to object to this or has previously objected to this

(e)introduction of a summary of background art that clearly represents the prior art closest to the invention (see F‑II, 4.3)

(f)amendments that, despite changing the meaning or scope of an independent claim, are very clearly necessary and so assumed acceptable to the applicant (see for example G‑VI, 6.1.2, G‑VI, 6.1.3 and G‑VI, 6.1.4 G‑VI, 7.1.2, G‑VI, 7.1.3 and G‑VI, 7.1.4)

(g)correction of linguistic and other minor errors

(h)reformulation of method-of-treatment claims into an allowable format (see G‑II, 4.2).

(i)deletion of redundant claims (e.g. omnibus claims and claims that the applicant has not deleted despite having incorporated their features into other claims).

Examples of amendments that may not be proposed without consulting the applicant:

(i) amendments that significantly change the meaning or scope of a claim when there are several different ways to amend it and the examiner cannot predict which amendment the applicant will agree to

(ii) deletion of entire claims, with the exception of so-called "omnibus claims" (i.e. claims reading "An apparatus substantially as described herein", or the like)

(iii) combining of claims to overcome a novelty or inventive step objection.

The above list is designed to avoid changes likely to be rejected by the applicant and thus to help avoid delays in the conclusion of examination proceedings. For the standard marks used by the division to indicate amendments and corrections using the in-house electronic tool, see C‑V, Annex.

The text is communicated to the applicant via a Rule 71(3) communication, which includes an invitation to pay the fee for grant and publishing (see C‑V, 1.2) and to file a translation of the claims in the two official EPO languages other than the language of the proceedings (see C‑V, 1.3) within a non-extendable period of four months. If the applicant pays the fees and files the translations in time (and files or requests no corrections or amendments to the text proposed in the Rule 71(3) communication, see C‑V, 4.1), they will be deemed to have approved the text intended for grant (Rule 71(5)).

If, during examination proceedings, a main request and auxiliary requests have been filed (see C‑IV, 1 and E‑X, 2.9) and one of the requests is allowable, the communication pursuant to Rule 71(3) is to be issued on the basis of the (first) allowable request unless there is a higher ranking request for oral proceedings (see E‑X, 2.2). and The communication pursuant to Rule 71(3) must briefly indicate the essential reasons for the non-allowability of the subject-matter of the higher-ranking requests or their inadmissibility (see also H‑III, 3). The examining division should provide sufficient information about the objections raised to enable the applicant to comment on them.

Handwritten amendments by the applicant to the description, claims and abstract, unless they involve graphic symbols and characters and chemical or mathematical formulae, are no longer accepted in strict compliance with Rule 50(1) in conjunction with Rule 49(2) (Art. 2(7) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A113) (see OJ EPO 2013, 603, and A‑III, 3.2). For the procedure to follow in oral proceedings, see E‑III, 8.7.

Rule 71(3)1.2 Grant and publishing fee

The communication under Rule 71(3) also invites the applicant to pay the fee for grant and publishing within a non-extendable four-month period. For European patent applications filed before 1 April 2009 and international applications entering the regional phase before that date, the fee for grant and printing may include an element depending on the number of pages, but for applications filed or entering the regional phase on or after that date, this additional element is payable as part of the filing fee (see A‑III, 13.2).1.3 Translations of the claims

The communication under Rule 71(3) also invites the applicant to file a translation of the claims in the two official EPO languages other than the language of the proceedings within a non-extendable four-month period.

If the application contains different sets of claims for particular contracting states (see H‑III, 4), a translation of all the sets of claims must be filed.

Only one copy of the translation needs to be filed.

Examiners should not concern themselves with the quality of the translation filed.

The translation should meet the requirements pursuant to Rule 50(1).

Rule 50(1)1.4 Claims fees due in response to Rule 71(3) communication

If the text of the European patent application serving as the basis for grant contains more than fifteen claims, the examining division requests the applicant to pay, within the period under Rule 71(3), claims fees in respect of each claim in excess of that number unless they have already done so under Rule 45(1) or Rule 162(1) and Rule 162(2) (see A‑III, 9). Where there is more than one set of claims, fees are incurred under Rule 45(1), Rule 162(1) and Rule 162(2), or Rule 71(4) only for the set with the highest number of claims.

If the text on which the Rule 71(3) communication is based contains fewer claims than the set in respect of which claims fees were paid on filing under Rule 45 or on entry into the European phase under Rule 162, no refund of claims fees will be made.

Where the communication under Rule 71(3) is based on an auxiliary request, the number of claims in the request determines the claims fees due in response to the communication. However, if the applicant replies by requesting a grant based on a higher-ranking request, no claims fees need to be paid in response to the communication (see C‑V, 4.1).

Rule 71(4) Rule 45(1) Rule 162(1) and Rule 162(2)1.5 Other information in the communication under Rule 71(3)

An annex to the Rule 71(3) communication indicates the contracting states validly designated as well as the extension and validation states for which the corresponding fees have been paid, the title of the invention in the three official languages, the international patent classification, the application's filing date, any priorities claimed, the designated inventors and the applicant's registered name.

The Rule 71(3) communication It also states that, where a renewal fee falls due between the communication's notification and the proposed date of the mention of the grant's publication, publication will be effected only after the renewal fee and any additional fee have been paid (see C‑V, 2).

Where the examining division changes its opinion after an earlier negative communication, it will communicate its reasons for this unless they are clear from the applicant's reply, from a communication or from the minutes of a consultation.

During the grant procedure an applicant may submit further technical information, for example:

– comparative tests

– further examples

– statements concerning the effects and/or advantages of the invention.

Technical information extending beyond the content of the application as filed, however, cannot be included in the application by way of amendment (Art. 123(2), H‑IV and H‑V). Such information is added to the file, which is open to inspection (Art. 128(4)), and its existence is indicated on the cover page of the patent specification.

All further documents that were neither cited in the application as filed nor mentioned in the search report but that were cited during the examination procedure are to be indicated, even if they have not been used in an objection concerning novelty or inventive step. This also applies to documents cited to show, for instance, a technical prejudice.2. Approval of the proposed text – grant of a patent

If an applicant pays the fee for grant and publishing along with any claims fees due under Rule 71(4) and files the translation of the claims within the specified period (and files or requests no corrections or amendments to the text proposed for grant in the Rule 71(3) communication, see C‑V, 4.1), they are deemed to have approved the text intended for grant.

The above also applies where the Rule 71(3) communication was based on an auxiliary request, provided that the applicant does not reply to the Rule 71(3) communication by requesting that a grant be based on a higher-ranking request. This means that, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, the above acts imply approval of the auxiliary request text upon which the Rule 71(3) communication was based as well as the abandonment of all higher-ranking requests.

The above also applies where the Rule 71(3) communication included the examining division's proposals for amendments or corrections to the text intended for grant (see C‑V, 1.1). Consequently, provided the applicant does not reject these proposals in their reply, completion of the above acts constitutes approval of the text amended or corrected by the examining division.

Rule 71(5) Art. 97(1)

Once all the requirements set out in C‑V, 1.1 to C-V, 1.4, are met, the decision to grant the European patent is issued, provided that renewal fees and any additional fees already due have been paid.

Rule 71a(1)

If a renewal fee falls due after the Rule 71(3) communication's notification but before the next possible date for publication of the mention of the European patent's grant, the decision to grant is not issued and the mention of the grant is not published until the renewal fee has been paid. The applicant is informed accordingly. If the renewal fee or any additional fee is not paid in time, the application is deemed withdrawn (see A‑X, 5.2.4).

Rule 71a(4) Art. 86(1)

In rare cases where examination was accelerated to such an extent that the Rule 71(3) communication is issued before the designation fee falls due, the decision to grant will not be issued and the mention of the grant will not be published until the designation fee has been paid. The applicant is informed accordingly. For European patent applications filed before 1 April 2009 or international applications entering the regional phase before that date, publication will not take place until the designation fees have been paid and the designation of states for which no designation fees have been paid has been withdrawn (see also A‑III, 11.1 and A-III, 11.3).

Rule 71a(3)

The decision to grant does not take effect until the date on which the grant is mentioned in the European Patent Bulletin.

For details about the possibility of requesting a delay in issuing the decision to grant a European patent in response to a Rule 71(3) communication until the entry into force of the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court (UPCA), see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 11 November 2022 as well as the notice from the EPO dated 11 November 2022 (OJ EPO 2022, A102 and OJ EPO 2022, A104 respectively).

For information about filing "early requests for unitary effect", see the notice from the EPO dated 11 November 2022 (OJ EPO 2022, A105).

Art. 97(3)

2.1 Request for unitary effect2.1 Request for unitary effect

Requests for unitary effect must be filed with the EPO no later than one month after the mention of the European patent's grant is published in the European Patent Bulletin (Rule 6 of the Rules relating to Unitary Patent Protection). To offer flexibility, users can file requests after the decision to grant the European patent is issued (EPO Form 2006A), see Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2023. Requests for unitary effect filed early will not be processed by the EPO before the date on which the mention of the European patent's grant is published in the European Patent Bulletin and will appear in the Register for unitary patent protection only from that date.3. No reply in time – application deemed withdrawn

If the applicant fails to pay the fee for grant and publishing or the claims fees or to file the translation within the period under Rule 71(3), the application is deemed withdrawn unless, within the same period, the applicant files or requests corrections or amendments to the text proposed for grant in the Rule 71(3) communication (see C‑V, 4.1).

Rule 71(7)

If the applicant fails to meet the time limit under Rule 71(3), further processing may be requested under Art. 121 (see E‑VIII, 2). In such a case, the omitted act to be completed would be either:

(i)all of the following acts referred to in Rule 71(3) and Rule 71(4):

(a)payment of the fee for grant and publishing

(b)payment of any claims fees due

(c)filing of the translations of the claims; or

(ii)one or more of the following acts:

(a)filing amendments and/or corrections to the application documents

(b)rejecting amendments proposed by the examining division in the Rule 71(3) communication

(c)requesting the grant to be based on a higher-ranking request than the auxiliary request on which the Rule 71(3) communication was based.

Art. 1214. Request for amendments or corrections in reply to the Rule 71(3) communication

If the applicant, within the period under Rule 71(3), requests reasoned amendments or corrections to the communicated text (see C‑V, 4.3 for the reasoning required), the examining division will issue a new Rule 71(3) communication if it gives its consent (i.e. if it finds the amendments admissible and allowable; see C‑V, 4.6); otherwise it will resume the examination proceedings (see C‑V, 4.7). This also applies in the following cases:

– if the applicant requests the reversal of amendments proposed by the examining division in the Rule 71(3) communication (see C‑V, 4.6.1)

– if the Rule 71(3) communication was based on an auxiliary request and the applicant replies by requesting that a grant be based on a higher-ranking request (see C‑V, 4.6.2 and 4.7.1.1).

In this and sections C‑V, 4.1 to C-V, 4.10, unless otherwise stated, the terms "amendments" and "corrections" refer only to amendments or corrections of the application documents and not of other documents (e.g. bibliographic data, the designation of the inventor, etc.).

Rule 71(6)

4.1 No payment of fees or filing of translations necessary

4.2 Crediting of fees paid voluntarily

4.3 Amendments or corrections should be reasoned

4.4 Admissibility of amendments

4.5 Adaptation of the description

4.6 Amendments/corrections admitted and allowable – second Rule 71(3) communication sent

4.7 Amendments not admitted and/or not allowable, examination resumed

4.8 Fees to be paid within the second Rule 71(3) period

4.9 Reply explicitly disapproving with the proposed text without indicating an alternative text

4.10 Amendments/corrections filed in second Rule 71(3) period4.1 No payment of fees or filing of translations necessary

In the case referred to in C‑V, 4, the applicant will not be required to pay the fee for grant and publishing or any claims fees in reply to the first Rule 71(3) communication, nor will they be required to file any translations of the claims within the relevant period. This applies irrespective of whether the examining division subsequently finds these amendments or corrections to be admissible and allowable and whether the amendments or corrections are reasoned (see C‑V, 4.3).

This also applies if the applicant requests the reversal of amendments proposed by the examining division in the Rule 71(3) communication (see C‑V, 1.1). And it applies if the Rule 71(3) communication was based on an auxiliary request and the applicant replies by requesting that a grant be based on a higher-ranking request.4.2 Crediting of fees paid voluntarily

Although the applicant is not required to pay fees in response to the Rule 71(3) communication when requesting amendments or corrections in their reply (see C‑V, 4.1), they can do so voluntarily. In that case, the amount of the fees paid will be credited to the payment of the same fees in response to a subsequent Rule 71(3) communication (issued either directly or after resumption of examination – see C‑V, 4.6 and C-V, 4.7.2 respectively).

This crediting will be dealt with according to the procedures explained in A‑X, 11. This is subject to the following: if the amount of the claims fees due in response to the second Rule 71(3) communication is less than the amount voluntarily paid in response to the first Rule 71(3) communication, a refund will be made of the excess paid since the higher claims fees were not due when paid in response to the first Rule 71(3) communication.

If, after such voluntary payment, the application is withdrawn, deemed withdrawn or refused, a refund of the voluntarily paid fee for grant and publishing will be possible under the conditions explained in A‑X, 10.2.5. Furthermore, since the claims fees were paid when they were not due, they will also be refunded under the same conditions.4.3 Amendments or corrections should be reasoned

The reasoning accompanying amendments or corrections filed in response to the Rule 71(3) communication should indicate respectively:

– why the applicant considers that the amended application documents comply with the EPC, in particular the patentability requirements, Art. 123(2) and Art. 84

– why the applicant considers that the errors and their proposed corrections are evident according to Rule 139.

If, within the period under Rule 71(3), the applicant files amendments or corrections that are not reasoned, no payment of the fee for grant and publishing or claims fees is necessary, nor is the filing of translations (see C‑V, 4.1). However, the absence of any reasoning means that such amendments or corrections are more likely to result in a resumption of the examination procedure (see C‑V, 4.7).4.4 Admissibility of amendments

The criteria for assessing the admissibility of amendments are dealt with in detail in H‑II, 2.5 and subsections.

By way of exception, in cases where the Rule 71(3) communication was also the first communication in examination proceedings, amendments filed in response must be admitted into the proceedings under Rule 137 in cases (i) to (iii) mentioned in H‑II, 2.2. However, where a further Rule 71(3) communication is sent in respect of such cases (see C‑V, 4.6 and C-V, 4.7.2), any amendments filed in response must be consented to by the examining division according to Rule 137(3) (see H‑II, 2.5).

Rule 137(3)4.5 Adaptation of the description

If the amendments or corrections filed by the applicant in the Rule 71(3) period concern the claims, the applicant should consider the need to adapt the description. To avoid potential delays in cases where adaptation is necessary, the applicant should provide an adapted description when filing amended claims in the Rule 71(3) period.

If no such adapted description is filed, the examining division may adapt the description by itself and propose these amendments in the second Rule 71(3) communication (see C‑V, 4.6.3). Alternatively, it may resume examination (see C‑V, 4.7) and send the applicant a communication under Art. 94(3) requesting the adapted description before issuing a second Rule 71(3) communication (see C‑V, 4.7.2).4.6 Amendments/corrections admitted and allowable – second Rule 71(3) communication sent

If the amendments and/or corrections filed within the period under Rule 71(3) are admitted under Rule 137(3) and also comply with the EPC, the examining division will send a second communication under Rule 71(3) based on them.

Rule 71(6)

4.6.1 Second Rule 71(3) communication reversing the amendments proposed by the examining division in first Rule 71(3) communication

4.6.2 Second Rule 71(3) communication based on higher-ranking request initially rejected in first Rule 71(3) communication

4.6.3 Examining division proposes amendments in second Rule 71(3) communication4.6.1 Second Rule 71(3) communication reversing the amendments proposed by the examining division in first Rule 71(3) communication

A second communication under Rule 71(3) is also sent if the applicant requests reversal of amendments proposed by the examining division in the first Rule 71(3) communication and the examining division overturns its previous opinion, finding that the amendments proposed earlier were not necessary, possibly as a consequence of arguments or evidence provided by the applicant in their reply to the first Rule 71(3) communication (in the absence of such convincing arguments or evidence, examination will normally be resumed; see C‑V, 4.7).4.6.2 Second Rule 71(3) communication based on higher-ranking request initially rejected in first Rule 71(3) communication

In cases where the first Rule 71(3) communication was based on an auxiliary request (see H‑III, 3, in particular H‑III, 3.1 and H-III, 3.3 and subsections), the first communication under Rule 71(3) would have been accompanied by an indication of why the examining division did not consider the higher-ranking requests admissible or allowable (see C‑V, 1.1). If the applicant replies to this first Rule 71(3) communication indicating their wish to base a grant on one of those higher-ranking requests (see C‑V, 1.1), that reply will normally lead to examination being resumed (see C‑V, 4.7 and 4.7.1.1). The examining division may reverse its opinion, for example due to convincing arguments or evidence filed by the applicant with their reply to the first Rule 71(3) communication. If the applicant is successful in this regard, the examining division will send a second communication under Rule 71(3) based on the higher-ranking request.4.6.3 Examining division proposes amendments in second Rule 71(3) communication

As with the first Rule 71(3) communication, the examining division may propose amendments to the applicant's latest request forming the basis for the second Rule 71(3) communication (this request includes amendments or corrections filed in response to the first Rule 71(3) communication). The types of amendment that may or may not be proposed by the examining division in the second Rule 71(3) communication are the same as those mentioned in C‑V, 1.1. However, in the second Rule 71(3) communication, the examining division cannot repropose amendments already rejected by the applicant. Where the examining division considers that such an amendment is necessary to overcome an objection, it should consider resuming examination (see C‑V, 4.7).4.7 Amendments not admitted and/or not allowable, examination resumed

The examining division may resume the examination proceedings at any time up to the decision to grant the European patent, including when the applicant files non-allowable or inadmissible amendments in response to the Rule 71(3) communication.

Rule 71a(2)

4.7.1 Communications/oral proceedings/refusal after resumption

4.7.2 Agreement reached on a text – second Rule 71(3) communication

4.7.3 No agreement reached on a text – refusal4.7.1 Communications/oral proceedings/refusal after resumption

If the examining division finds the amendments submitted by the applicant in reply to the Rule 71(3) communication either inadmissible or not allowable, it will resume the examination proceedings.

The next action may be a communication under Art. 94(3) or a consultation with the applicant (see C‑VII, 2). The examining division may also issue a summons to oral proceedings or, if the necessary requirements are met, refuse the application directly.

Where the grounds or evidence behind the finding of non-allowability or inadmissibility of the amendments have not yet been dealt with in examination proceedings, before issuing a summons to oral proceedings or a decision to refuse (see C‑V, 4.7.3) the examining division will send a communication according to Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and (2) explaining this finding.

Art. 94(3) Rule 71(1) and Rule 71(2)

The application may be refused directly if the following criteria are satisfied:

(a)the grounds leading to the finding that the requests filed in response to the Rule 71(3) communication are inadmissible or not allowable have already been formally dealt with in examination proceedings (Art. 113(1)), for example in a communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and Rule 71(2) (see C‑III, 4, E‑X, 1.1); and

(b)the applicant's right to oral proceedings on request has been respected (Art. 116(1)).

Art. 97(2)

If one of the following situations applies, the examining division will have to arrange for the holding of oral proceedings before issuing a decision to refuse (see C‑V, 4.7.3):

(i)oral proceedings have been requested but have not yet been held

(ii)oral proceedings have been held, but:

– the subject of the proceedings has changed such that a right to subsequent oral proceedings arises under Art. 116(1) (e.g. as a result of the amendments filed in response to the Rule 71(3) communication) and

– the applicant has requested subsequent oral proceedings.

If the grounds and evidence behind for the finding amendments non-allowableof non-allowability or inadmissibleinadmissibility of the amendments have already been dealt with in examination proceedings, but not yet in oral proceedings, a summons to oral proceedings can be issued directly, provided at least one communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and (2) has been issued.

Requests for oral proceedings must be allowed as long as proceedings before the EPO are still pending, i.e. until the decision to grant has been handed over to the internal post (see G 12/91 and T 556/95, especially reasons for the decision 4.4).

Art. 116(1)

If the following criteria are satisfied, the application may be refused directly:

(a)the grounds and evidence behind the non-allowabilityallowance or non-admittanceinadmissibility of the request filed in response to the Rule 71(3) communication have already been dealt with in examination proceedings (Art. 113(1));

(b)the applicant has received at least one communication according tounder Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and (2) (see C‑III, 4); and

(c)the applicant's right to oral proceedings on request has been respected (Art. 116(1)).

Art. 97(2)

4.7.1.1 Higher-ranking request not admissible and/or not allowable4.7.1.1 Higher-ranking request not admissible and/or not allowable

If the applicant replies to the Rule 71(3) communication by requesting that a grant be based on a higher-ranking request but the examining division is not convinced by the arguments and evidence filed with their reply, the examining division resumes examination following the procedure in C‑V, 4.7.1. The examining division may also directly refuse the application providing a full reasoning under the proviso that:

– the short indication of the essential reasons given in the Rule 71(3) communication for the non-allowability of the subject-matter of the higher-ranking requests or the inadmissibility of these requests (see C‑V, 1.1 and C‑V, 4.6.2) provides sufficient information about the objections raised by the examining division to enable the applicant to comment on them (such that the applicant is not taken by surprise, in particular where amendments or corrections have been filed together with their disagreement; see C‑V, 4.7.1) and

– the applicant's right to oral proceedings on request has been respected (Art. 116(1)) (see also H‑III, 3.3.2).

For the purposes of determining whether the reasons not to grant the higher-ranking requests given in the Rule 71(3) communication allow the division to issue a refusal, a general indication such as "Auxiliary request 3 is not clear because an essential feature is missing" is not sufficient. Rather, a more detailed statement is needed to ensure that the applicant's right to be heard is properly respected. For example, the division may provide the applicant with an explanation such as: "Auxiliary request 3 is not inventive in view of D1 (see col. 5, lines 25-46; fig. 4) because the skilled person, wishing to avoid friction between the cable and the carpet, would make the clip recess deeper than the cable diameter".4.7.2 Agreement reached on a text - second Rule 71(3) communication

If the resumption of examination described in C‑V, 4.7.1 results in an allowable and admissible text being filed or in the applicant convincing the examining division that the text already filed in response to the Rule 71(3) communication is in fact admissible and allowable, a second Rule 71(3) communication is sent based on this agreed text. Such cases are dealt with in the same way as described in C‑V, 4.6.

Rule 71(6)4.7.3 No agreement reached on a text - refusal

If no agreement can be reached on a text after examination is resumed, the application is refused (see C‑V, 14). For details on conducting resumed examination proceedings before issuing such a decision, see C‑V, 4.7.1.

Art. 97(2)4.8 Fees to be paid within the second Rule 71(3) period

Where the applicant files amendments or corrections in response to the first communication under Rule 71(3), they do not have to pay either the fee for grant and publishing or the claims fees (see C‑V, 4.1). A second Rule 71(3) communication may then be issued either immediately (where the amended/corrected text is allowable, see C‑V, 4.6) or after examination is resumed and an allowable text is agreed on (see C‑V, 4.7.2).

4.8.1 Claims fees

4.8.2 Fee for grant and publishing4.8.1 Claims fees

For the text on which the second Rule 71(3) communication is based to be deemed approved according to Rule 71(5), the applicant must pay any claims fees due in response to the communication, thus also avoiding deemed withdrawal of the application under Rule 71(7). For the calculation of claims fees due at this stage, see C‑V, 1.4.

Since no claims fees would normally have been paid in response to the first Rule 71(3) communication, the number of claims in the text on which this first communication was based plays no role in calculating the amount of the claims fees due in response to the second Rule 71(3) communication. However, in cases where the applicant paid the claims fees voluntarily in response to the first Rule 71(3) communication, the amount paid is credited according to Rule 71a(5) (see C‑V, 4.2 and A‑X, 11.2).4.8.2 Fee for grant and publishing

For the text on which the second Rule 71(3) communication is based to be deemed approved according to Rule 71(5), the applicant must pay the fee for grant and publishing in response to the communication, thus also avoiding deemed withdrawal of the application under Rule 71(7).

For European patent applications filed before 1 April 2009 or international applications entering the European phase before that date, the fee for grant and publishing incorporates a fee for each page of the application in excess of 35 (see C‑V, 1.2 and A‑III, 13.2). If the number of pages of such an application changes between the first and second Rule 71(3) communication, it is the number of pages on which the second Rule 71(3) communication is based that is used to calculate the fee amount. Where the applicant paid the fee voluntarily in response to the first Rule 71(3) communication, the amount paid will be credited according to Rule 71a(5) (see C‑V, 4.2 and A‑X, 11.1).

Art. 2(2), No 7.2 RFees4.9 Reply explicitly disapproving with the proposed text without indicating an alternative text

If the applicant replies to the communication under Rule 71(3) by simply disapproving with the text proposed for grant, not indicating an alternative and not paying any fees or filing the translations of the claims, the following will apply:

(1)If the text proposed for grant was based on the main request submitted by the applicant (without any amendments or corrections proposed by the examining division), the application will be refused, provided that at least one communication in examination proceedings has been sent (see C‑III, 4 and E‑IX, 4.1) and the applicant's right to oral proceedings is respected (Art. 116(1)) the criteria in C‑V, 4.7.1 are met. The basis for the refusal in this case is the absence of an application text agreed to by the applicant (Art. 113(2)).

(2)If amendments or corrections were proposed by the division in the Rule 71(3) communication, the applicant's disagreement is interpreted as a rejection of the proposal and the procedure continues as described in C‑V, 4.6.1.

(3)If the communication under Rule 71(3) was based on an auxiliary request, the applicant's disagreement is interpreted as a request to base the grant on a higher-ranking request. The procedure continues as described in C‑V, 4.6.2 and 4.7.1.1. If it is not clear which higher-ranking request the applicant wishes to pursue, the examining division must request clarification of this in resumed examination proceedings.

If the applicant first files only their disagreement with the text and then (still within the Rule 71(3) period) a request for amendment or correction, this is interpreted as a desire to proceed with the application as amended or corrected. The procedure in C‑V, 4 applies.4.10 Amendments/corrections filed in second Rule 71(3) period

In cases where a second Rule 71(3) communication is sent (see C‑V, 4.6 and C-V, 4.7.2) and the applicant replies within the second Rule 71(3) period by doing one or more of the following, the procedures explained in C‑V, 4.1 to C-V, 4.9 apply mutatis mutandis:

(i)filing further amendments or corrections

(ii)rejecting amendments proposed by the examining division in the second Rule 71(3) communication

(iii)reverting to a higher-ranking request (where the second Rule 71(3) communication is based on an auxiliary request).

In particular, in such cases the applicant will be required neither to pay the fee for grant and publishing or any claims fees, nor to file translations of the claims within this second period under Rule 71(3). If the examining division agrees to a text (either with or without resumption of examination), a third communication under Rule 71(3) is then sent.

Furthermore, if the applicant replies to the second Rule 71(3) communication by rejecting amendments proposed by the examining division in the first Rule 71(3) communication (where these have not been superseded), the procedures described in C‑V, 4.1 to C-V, 4.9 likewise apply mutatis mutandis (no need to pay fees or file translations, etc.).

In respect of repeated requests for amendments in response to the second or subsequent Rule 71(3) communication, the division may exercise its discretion under Rule 137(3) not to admit such amendments (H‑II, 2.5.1). If the division intends not to admit the amendments, it will resume the examination proceedings, e.g. by summoning the applicant to oral proceedings.5. Further requests for amendment after approval

The criteria for assessing the admissibility of such amendments are dealt with in detail in H‑II, 2.6. The procedure for dealing with such late-filed amendments is explained in C‑V, 6.

Rule 137(3)6. The examining division resumes examination after approval of the text

6.1 When does the examining division resume examination after approval?

6.2 A further communication under Rule 71(3)

6.3 Crediting of fees under Rule 71a(5)6.1 When does the examining division resume examination after approval?

Following the applicant's approval in response to the Rule 71(3) communication (see C‑V, 2), the examining division may resume the examination procedure at any time up to the moment the decision to grant is handed over to the EPO's internal postal service for transmittal to the applicant (see G 12/91). This will seldom occur, but may be necessary if:

– the applicant files further prior art necessitating further substantive examination

– the examining division becomes aware of very relevant prior art following observations by third parties under Art. 115

– the applicant files amendments or corrections (having already approved the text)

– the examining division becomes aware in some other way of circumstances that cause the subject-matter claimed to fail to comply with the EPC.

The resumption of examination after approval is subject to the same considerations as resumption due to amendments filed in the Rule 71(3) period (see C‑V, 4.7.1). The next action issued after resumption of examination must however indicate that the proceedings have been resumed as well as the substantive reasons that led to the resumption. In particular, the applicant's right to comment (Art. 113(1)), the right to at least one communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and Rule 71(2) in examination proceedings (see C‑III, 4) and the right to oral proceedings on request (Art. 116(1)) must be respected.

Rule 71a(2)

The criteria applied in assessing the admissibility of amendments or corrections filed by the applicant after approval are dealt with in H‑II, 2.6.

Rule 137(3)6.2 A further communication under Rule 71(3)

A second Rule 71(3) communication is issued if the resumed examination results in a text on the basis of which a patent can be granted (substantive amendments directed to resolving the issues which gave rise to the resumption of examination are possible).

If the translations of the claims have already been filed (see C‑V, 1.3) and the fees paid (see C‑V, 1.2 and 1.4) in reply to a previous Rule 71(3) communication, e.g. in the case of resumption of examination after approval (see C‑V, 6 and Rule 71(6)), the applicant must express agreement as to the text to be granted (Rule 71a(1)) within the non-extendable four-month period mentioned in the further Rule 71(3) communication (e.g. by approving the text and verifying the bibliographic data, by confirming that grant proceedings can continue based on the documents on file and/or by stating which translations of the claims already on file are to be used). This also applies if a further Rule 71(3) communication was sent.

Rule 71(6)6.3 Crediting of fees under Rule 71a(5)

If, in response to an invitation under Rule 71(3), the applicant has already paid the fee for grant and publishing or the claims fees, the amount paid will be credited if a further such invitation is issued. For more details, see A‑X, 11.

Rule 71a(5)7. Correction of errors in the decision to grant

Under certain circumstances, a decision to grant a European patent may be corrected. For more details, see H‑VI, 3.8. Further processing

If the applicant fails to meet the time limit under Rule 71(3), further processing may be requested under Art. 121 (see E‑VIII, 2). The procedure to follow is explained in C‑V, 3.9. Refund of the fee for grant and publishing

If the application is refused, withdrawn prior to notification of the decision on the grant of a European patent or, at that time, deemed withdrawn, the fee for grant and publishing will be refunded (for more details, see A‑X, 10.2.5).

Rule 71a(6)10. Publication of the patent specification

The decision to grant contains the date of the mention of the European patent's grant and is sent to the applicant when the technical preparations for printing the patent specification have been completed.

As soon as possible after the mention of the grant is published in the Bulletin, the EPO publishes the patent specification containing the description, claims (in the three official languages) and any drawings. The front page of the published specification shows, in particular, the contracting states still designated at the time of grant (or whose designation has been withdrawn after completion of the technical preparations for printing). Regarding the form in which the publication takes place, see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, D.3.

Mistakes in a European patent specification made during its production have no effect on the content of the patent granted. For this, only the text on which the decision to grant is based is decisive (see H‑VI, 4). If necessary, the EPO may arrange for correction to be made public as soon as any mistake in a specification is discovered. This is done by means of a note in the European Patent Bulletin and publication of a corrigendum, the sole purpose being to bring the specification into line with the content of the decision to grant (see Rule 143(2) and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 October 2009, OJ EPO 2009, 598, Art. 1, point 2 15 July 2014, OJ EPO 2014, A86, Art. 1(2)).

Art. 98 Rule 73 Art. 14(6)11. Withdrawal before publication of the patent specification

The European patent specification is not published if the application is withdrawn before termination of the technical preparations for publication. If, after termination of the technical preparations, the application is withdrawn to avoid publication, non-publication cannot be guaranteed. The EPO will, however, try (in accordance with the principles of J 5/81) to prevent publication on a case-by-case basis if the stage reached in the publication procedure permits this reasonably easily. The application may be withdrawn by means of a signed declaration, which should be unqualified and unambiguous (see J 11/80). The applicant is bound by an effective declaration of withdrawal (see J 25/03, J 4/97 and J 10/87) (see also E‑VIII, 8).

Rule 7312. Certificate

As soon as the European patent specification has been published, the EPO issues the proprietor with a certificate attesting that the European patent has been granted to the person named on the certificate. Where there is more than one proprietor, each of them is issued with a certificate. Proprietors may request that a certified copy of the certificate with the specification attached be supplied to them upon payment of an administrative fee. For further details see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 17 December 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A94, and the notice from the EPO dated 17 December 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A95.

Rule 7413. European Patent Bulletin

If no notice of opposition is recorded in the dossier of the European patent within nine months of publication of the mention of grant, the patent proprietor is informed and an appropriate entry is published in the European Patent Bulletin (point 1, Art. 1 Art. 1(1) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 October 2009, OJ EPO 2009, 598 15 July 2014, OJ EPO 2014, A86). If it subsequently emerges that an opposition was filed in due time, the proprietor is again informed and a correction is published in the Bulletin.

Art. 129(a)14. Refusal

A decision to refuse the application cannot be issued without a first communication in examination having been sent (see C‑III, 4 and E‑IX, 4.1) or oral proceedings having been held (see C‑III, 5). Consequently, the examining division may not refuse the application directly after the reply to the search opinion under Rule 70a(1) or directly after the reply to the WO‑ISA under Rule 161(1), even if the objections raised in the search opinion or WO‑ISA remain the same and there is no pending request for oral proceedings. The examining division may also not refuse the application if the only communication issued is under Rule 137(4).

If, despite the applicant's submissions, i.e. amendments or counter-arguments, objections persist after the applicant's reply to the first communication under Art. 94(3) in examination, then a refusal can be issued. If there is a pending request for oral proceedings, oral proceedings must be held and the decision to refuse will, where appropriate, be announced at the end of them. Similarly, if a summons was issued as the first action in examination, the decision to refuse will, where appropriate, be announced at the end of the oral proceedings.

If a refusal is envisaged, the examiner first member should bring the application before the other members of the examining division, who may then decide to refuse the application. In any event, the first examiner member will always consult the other members of the division at some stage to establish whether an application should be refused or a patent granted. If the division intends to refuse the application, a written reasoned decision is necessary and this will normally be prepared by the first examiner member (see E‑X, 2.3 and E‑X, 2.6). In preparing the decision, the examiner first member must take care to abide by the general principles set out in Art. 113(1), i.e. the decision must be based on grounds or evidence that the applicant has had the opportunity to comment on (see E‑X, 1.1 and E‑X, 1.2).

In addition, the applicant's attention must be directed to the provisions for appeal laid down in Art. 106 to Art. 108. If oral proceedings take place (see E‑III), the decision may be given orally but must subsequently be notified in writing, the time limit for appeal then running from the date of such notification.

Art. 97(2) Art. 113(1) Rule 111 Art. 109 Art. 111(1) and Art. 111(2)

If the applicant appeals against the decision and the examining division considers, in the light of the applicant's statement, that the appeal is admissible and well-founded, it should rectify its decision accordingly within three months after receipt of the statement of grounds. Otherwise, the appeal will be considered by a board of appeal. If a decision to refuse a patent is reversed on appeal, the application may be referred back to the examining division for further examination. In such a case, the further examination will normally be entrusted to the examiner who performed the original examination. The examining division is bound by the reasoning of the board of appeal in so far as the facts are the same.

Art. 10915. Decision according to the state of the file

A special case is where the applicant does not file comments or amendments in reply to the examiner's communication but requests a decision "according to the state of the file" or "on the file as it stands", meaning that the applicant wishes to close the debate and a decision is taken on the basis of the current status of the application and any supporting arguments. The decision, which may be appealed, may only be based on grounds and evidence that the applicant has had an opportunity to comment on (Art. 113(1)).

15.1 The request for a decision according to the state of the file

15.2 Decision by means of a standard form

15.3 Issuing a self-contained decision

15.4 Issuing a further communication (no refusal)15.1 The request for a decision according to the state of the file

An applicant may file a request for a decision according to the state of the file at any stage during examination proceedings, provided that at least one communication in examination has been sent (see also C‑V, 15.4). The request should be in writing (see C‑VII, 2.3) and should be explicit and unambiguous, preferably using the wording "according to the state of the file" or "on the file as it stands".

If the request is not clear in this respect, the examiner should solve the ambiguity with an enquiry to the applicant.

If, at the time the applicant files a request for a decision according to the state of the file, a request for oral proceedings is pending, the examining division will interpret the request for a decision as equivalent to the applicant's implicit withdrawal of the pending request for oral proceedings.15.2 Decision by means of a standard form

If the applicant has filed an explicit and unambiguous request for a decision according to the state of the file (see C‑V, 15.1) in their latest reply, the examiner may be in a position to refuse the application using a standard form referring to the previous communication. To comply with the requirement that such a decision be reasoned (Rule 111(2)), a number of conditions have to be met:

(i)the previous communication must properly identify the application documents on file, be well-reasoned and complete with respect to the grounds and the reasons for the refusal of the current request and address all the arguments raised by the applicant

(ii)no new arguments or amendments have been submitted by the applicant since the previous communication

(iii)all objections raised in the previous communication referred to must still apply for the applicant to be in a position to ascertain the reasons underlying the decision and ensure compliance with Rule 111(2).

If, in its reply to the last communication from the examining division, the applicant has submitted new arguments that are at least likely to be effective, these arguments cannot be ignored even if, in the same reply, the applicant has explicitly requested a decision according to the state of the file. In this case, the division must consider these freshly presented arguments either by issuing a regular reasoned decision (see C‑V, 15.3) or by issuing a further communication (see C‑V, 15.4).

Minutes of a consultation do not meet the standards of an Art. 94(3) communication. A decision according to the state of the file by means of a standard form cannot therefore can be based on such minutes of a consultation unless if they contain a full exposition of all the legal and factual reasons for refusing the application, as in the case of minutes of a consultation issued as the first communication in examination (see C‑VII, 2.5).

Examining divisions are not to refer either to the minutes of oral proceedings in decisions by means of a standard form.

Although it is possible by way of exception to refer to more than one communication in the standard form, the examiner should carefully consider the requirements of Rule 111(2). In particular, if the different communications deal with different sets of claims, such that it is not clear which of the reasons given by the examining division in its communications might be essential to the decision to refuse, a fully reasoned decision should be issued instead (see C‑V, 15.3).15.3 Issuing a self-contained decision

If the conditions set out in C‑V, 15.2 are not met, a self-contained decision to refuse must be issued to comply with Rule 111(2). This is necessary, for example, where the numerous objections raised in the previous communications with respect to different sets of claims render unclear the grounds and the reasons for the refusal. This also applies if the applicant has made further submissions (including amendments) since the previous communication, where these do not cause the subsequent decision to be based on grounds or evidence on which the applicant has not had the opportunity to present comments. In all cases, the requirements of Art. 113(1) should be carefully considered (see also E‑X, 1).15.4 Issuing a further communication (no refusal)

If it appears that the previous communications were insufficiently reasoned or incomplete, or if the applicant has filed amendments and/or arguments since the previous communication, the examiner should carefully consider Art. 113(1) and Rule 111(2) before issuing a refusal (see E‑X, 1). A further communication may have to be issued with sufficient reasoning unless oral proceedings are to be held (see E‑III, 2), in which case the reasoning would be given in the summons (Rule 116(1)). In the communication or summons the applicant should be informed that the request for a decision according to the state of the file could not be followed.Chapter V – Annex Standard marks for indicating amendments or corrections by the divisions

1. Insertion of letters and words

Any insertion made using the in-house electronic tool is done in the text itself. No separate marks are needed in the margins or at the top or bottom of the page.

In the PDF file created from the working copy of the document prepared for the printer ("Druckexemplar"), the tool will insert change bars to the right of amendments and indicate amended pages as such. The tool also adds pairs of insertion signs to mark the beginning and end of each insertion:

Mark Explanation Denotes the beginning of text inserted Denotes the end of text inserted

"No break", "line break" or "paragraph break" signs precede and follow the signs above to indicate whether the inserted text should be kept in the same line or if a new line or paragraph should start before or after the inserted text:

Mark Explanation No breaks: inserted text is kept on the same line (this is the default) Line break: starts a new line (must be set if needed) ¶ Paragraph break: starts a new paragraph (must be set if needed)

If inserting an entire newly filed page, e.g. a page numbered "1a", the instruction [insert page 1a] is used.Chapter VI – Time limits and acceleration of examination

1. Time limits for response to communications from the examiner

2. Influencing the speed of examination proceedings – PACE

3. Further ways to accelerate examination1. Time limits for response to communications from the examiner

1.1 General considerations

1.2 Special circumstances1.1 General considerations

The general considerations relating to time limits are set out in E‑VIII. The time limit for response to a communication from the examiner should in general be between two and four months in accordance with Rule 132. The period to be allowed will be determined by the examiner taking all the factors relevant to the particular application into account. These include the language normally used by the applicant or their representative; the number and nature of the objections raised; the length and technical complexity of the application; the proximity of the EPO to the applicant or, if they have one, their representative and the distance separating the two.

If the only outstanding objection is the need to amend the description, the examiner may invite the applicant to amend the description by issuing a communication under Art. 94(3) with a two-month time limit to reply. Alternatively, the examiner may consult the applicant informally, e.g. by telephone, explain the objection and set a one-month time limit documented in the minutes of the consultation referring to this objection (unless a shorter limit is agreed during the consultation).

This time limit can be extended if the applicant so requests before it expires (see E‑VIII, 1.6). Failure to respond to a communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and Rule 71(2) in due time results in the application being deemed withdrawn. This loss of rights is subject to further processing (see E‑VIII, 2).

Art. 94(1) and Art. 94(4) Rule 1321.2 Special circumstances

In certain special circumstances the examiner may allow a time limit of up to six months. The six-month period may be appropriate, for instance, if the applicant resides a long way from the representative and the language of the proceedings is not one to which the applicant is accustomed; or if the subject-matter of the application or the objections raised are exceptionally complicated (for more information see E‑VIII, 1.2).

The search opinion is not a communication under Art. 94(3).2. Influencing the speed of examination proceedings – PACE

With a request for accelerated examination under the programme for accelerated prosecution of European patent applications (PACE), the applicant can speed up the proceedings at the examination stage (see the notice from the EPO dated 30 November 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A93). For further information, see E‑VIII, 4.2.3. Further ways to accelerate examination

Where the applicant files a request for examination before the search report is transmitted to them, they may also dispense with the need to comply with the invitation pursuant to Rule 70(2) and file a categorical request for examination whatever the search result may be, thereby also accelerating the procedure (see the notice from the EPO dated 30 November 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A93). In this case, confirmation that they desire to proceed further with their application is deemed given when the search report is transmitted to them so that in accordance with Rule 62(1) the search report is not accompanied by a search opinion. Under these circumstances, if the application is not in order for grant, a communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and Rule 71(2) is transmitted to the applicant. Own-volition amendments under Rule 137(2) may in that case be submitted by the applicant in reply to this communication (see C‑III, 2).

If the application is in order for grant, the subsequent procedure will depend on whether it is possible at that time to carry out the search for conflicting European patent applications according to Art. 54(3) (see C‑IV, 7.1 and B‑XI, 7). If it can, and assuming no conflicting applications are identified, then the communication under Rule 71(3) is transmitted to the applicant. If it cannot yet be carried out, then the communication from the examining division will be postponed until the said search is completed. If the European patent application is subsequently withdrawn before the substantive examination has begun, the examination fee will be refunded in full. If substantive examination has already begun, withdrawal of the application may still result in a refund of 50% of the examination fee in the cases laid down in Art. 11(b) RFees (for more details, see A‑VI, 2.5 and OJ EPO 2016, A49).

The applicant can also accelerate the processing of Euro-PCT applications by waiving the right to the communication under Rule 161 and Rule 162 (see E‑IX, 3.1) or by filing an explicit request for early processing of an international application by the EPO as designated/elected Office (see E‑IX, 2.8).

2.1 General

2.2 Persons participating in the consultation

2.3 Informal nature of consultations

2.4 Minutes of a consultation

2.5 Minutes as the first communication in examination2.1 General

There are instances where personal consultation with the applicant can be helpful in advancing the procedure. Such a consultation will preferably be held by videoconference so that, where necessary, documents can be presented, other persons participate and the identity of those attending verified (see C‑VII, 2.2). The shared area in MyEPO Portfolio provides a space for applicants and examiners to upload documents and informally discuss changes (see OJ EPO 2023, A59). Consultations However, consultations can also be held by telephone at the request of the applicant, if the situation so requires.

The consultation may take place at the initiative of either the applicant or the examiner or formalities officer. However, the decision on whether it is to be held is up to the formalities officer or examiner. A consultation request from the applicant should usually be granted unless the nature of the issue to be discussed requires formal proceedings or the examiner believes that no useful purpose would be served by such a discussion. For example, where substantial differences of opinion exist in examination, written procedure or oral proceedings are normally more appropriate.

Typical situations in which the applicant may want a consultation are:

(i)to enquire about a procedural issue such as how to proceed in particular circumstances (note however that the examiner is not normally in charge of formal issues such as extensions of time limits and payment of fees); for enquiries as to the processing of files, see E‑VIII, 7

(ii)where there appears to be an error in the communication or in the applicant's reply making it difficult for them or the examiner to prepare the next reply/communication (e.g. wrong document cited, communication based on wrong set of claims, new submissions referred to but not included).

Typical situations in which the examiner may consider it appropriate to consult the applicant are:

(iii)where there appears to be confusion about certain points in dispute, e.g. the applicant seems to have misunderstood the examiner's arguments – or vice versa – so that the written procedure is leading nowhere

(iv)where the application seems to be ready for grant except that the examiner needs to clarify some minor issues with the applicant or would like to discuss a proposal for amendments to overcome the objections raised

(v)where amendments or corrections requested by the applicant after the Rule 71(3) communication have been submitted but the examiner cannot agree to them.

For consultations in response to the EESR before the application has entered the examination phase, see B‑XI, 8.

Telephone conversations held for the sole purpose of arranging a date for a consultation or oral proceedings do not in and of themselves constitute a consultation within the meaning of this section. Therefore, no minutes need to be prepared (C‑VII, 2.4) unless so required where the applicant agrees to a notice period of less than two months for oral proceedings (E‑III, 6).2.2 Persons participating in the consultation

The person consulted must be entitled to act for the applicant before the EPO. If the applicant is a natural or legal person having either residence or place of business in a contracting state, consultations may only be conducted with:

(a)the applicant (see A‑VIII, 1.1)

(b)a professional representative (see A‑VIII, 1.1)

(c)a duly authorised employee of the applicant (see A‑VIII, 1.2) or, to the extent defined in Art. 134(8), a legal practitioner (see A‑VIII, 1.4).

Regarding (c), see also A‑VIII, 1.5.

If the applicant is a natural or legal person having neither residence nor place of business in a contracting state, consultations may only be conducted with:

– a professional representative (see A‑VIII, 1.1)

– a legal practitioner (see A‑VIII, 1.4 and A‑VIII, 1.5).

The person entitled to act before the EPO, i.e. one of those listed above, may be accompanied by other persons, such as the inventor, a non-European representative or an employee of the applicant. At the request of the entitled person, such other persons may be allowed to take part in the consultation if their participation is relevant to the proceedings. Where the consultation is held by videoconference, these persons may connect from a different location than the entitled person.

If there is any doubt as to the identity of any of the persons participating in the consultation or if the consulted person so requests, the examiner or formalities officer will check the identity of the person or persons concerned. This can be done by inviting them to show an official identity document to the camera in the case of a videoconference or to send a copy of the document by email. For data protection reasons, the copy of the identity document sent by email will not be included in the file (see also E‑III, 8.3.1).

From the examining division, only the examiner first member dealing with the case will normally be present. However, there is no objection to one or even both of the other members participating in the consultation.

When the inventor or an expert is attending the consultation, it is recommended that the chair of the examining division at least should also attend. However, the applicant or representative does not have the right to demand the presence of additional division members. If a request is made for a consultation with all three members, it will usually be advisable to arrange for the holding of oral proceedings instead.2.3 Informal nature of consultations

A consultation is not a formal procedure (for formal oral proceedings before the examining division, see E‑III), and the character of the minutes of the consultation depends on the nature of the matters discussed. It should always be made clear to the applicant that any agreement reached is ultimately subject to the views of the other members of the examining division. A decision cannot be taken during a consultation.

Oral statements made during a consultation must be confirmed in writing in order to be procedurally effective. Indeed, such statements are not normally legally binding. Such a statement cannot, for instance, be effective to meet a time limit (see, however, C‑VII, 2.4). For the purpose of the European grant procedure, except in oral proceedings, only written statements are effective and only from the date on which they are received by the EPO. Oral statements substantively addressing the objections raised in an earlier communication may however lead the examiner to cancel any running time limit (see C‑VII, 2.4 (iv)). Furthermore, documents validly submitted by email during the consultation (see C‑VII, 3) may indeed be effective to meet a running time limit (see C‑IV, 3).

If a fresh objection of substance is raised during a consultation and no amendment to meet it is agreed at the time, the objection must be confirmed by a communication of the minutes of the consultation, giving the applicant a fresh period within which to reply (see C‑VII, 2.4(iii)).2.4 Minutes of a consultation

The minutes of a consultation should list the participants, summarise the main results and state any oral requests. They must be signed by the examiner. Documents filed by email during a consultation (see C‑VII, 3), such as new claims or an amended description, must be attached to the minutes.

The minutes should always indicate whether the next action is due to come from the applicant or the examiner. In this regard, the minutes when despatched to the applicant may:

(i)be issued for information only, in which case if a time limit is still pending, it should be observed; if no time limit is pending, no action is required from the applicant

(ii)be issued such as to extend a pending time limit, in which case the applicant must reply within that extended time limit

(iii)be issued such as to set a new time limit for response, in which case the applicant must reply within this new time limit

(iv)be issued such as to cancel a pending time limit

(v)be issued such as to reflect the decision to cancel scheduled oral proceedings. This may be the case, for instance, when where an agreement on an allowable set of claims can be reached during the consultation. Cancellation of the oral proceedings is communicated to the applicant orally during the consultation and noted in the minutes. No separate communication regarding the cancellation of the oral proceedings is issued.

(vi)be issued for information only where the applicant announces during the consultation that they do not intend to attend oral proceedings. The applicant is informed that oral statements must be confirmed in writing to be procedurally effective (see C‑VII, 2.3).

Where the consultation is concerned with the clarification of obscurities, the resolution of uncertainties or putting the application in order by clearing up a number of minor points, it will usually be sufficient for the examiner to make a note in the minutes of the matters discussed and the conclusions reached or amendments agreed unless a time limit is set for reply (see below).

Where the consultation involves the discussion of weightier matters, such as questions of novelty, inventive step, unity or whether the amendment introduces added subject-matter, a fuller note of the topics raised will be made in the minutes. In particular, the minutes will specify in concrete terms the topics discussed, together with any amendments agreed, any opposing views, the reasons for any change of opinion and any conclusions drawn unless these are clear from other documents in the dossier. Furthermore, the reasons for any amendments required by the examiner should be clearly indicated.

It is important to avoid statements that are unclear, ambiguous or universally applicable in the minutes. For example, statements such as "Amendments to the claims were proposed to take account of the prior art cited in the search report" are of no assistance to members of the public, other members of the division or indeed the first examiner member at later stages of the procedure. The same applies to conclusions worded in a generalised manner.

If the minutes are sent as a first communication in examination, see C‑VII, 2.5.

The minutes are placed in the dossier, made available for file inspection (including all documents filed by an applicant or representative during the consultation) and sent to the applicant or their representative, even where the consultation merely changes/confirms/cancels the time/date of a proposed consultation.

However, by way of exception, consultations relating to amendments agreed immediately prior to completing the Rule 71(3) communication may be reflected in that communication, provided that there is no uncertainty for the public as to what was agreed. The amendments must be identified as precisely as possible.2.5 Minutes as the first communication in examination

A consultation may be used as the first action in examination provided that:

– minutes are issued

– the minutes present the matters discussed with the same level of information and structure as an Art. 94(3) communication

– the minutes are issued with a time limit for reply not shorter than four months unless agreed otherwise with the applicant.

Matters (e.g. objections or reasoning) not discussed during the consultation itself may be included in such minutes. However, it must be made clear that they were not discussed during the consultation.

If the above criteria are met, minutes issued as the first action in examination replace the first communication under Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1), (2) (see C‑III, 4).

Where the examining division is considering issuing a summons to oral proceedings as the first action in examination (see C‑III, 5), the examiner may inform the representative of this in a call. Instead of issuing separate minutes, a remark regarding the call may be included in the summons. If, however, the examining division decides not to issue summons at that stage, minutes must be issued.3. Use of email

At present, email is an admissible filing means only for the submission of subsequently filed documents as referred to in Rule 50 during consultations and during oral proceedings held by videoconference (for details, in particular on signature and format of attachments, see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 13 May 2020, OJ EPO 2020, A71, and E‑III, 8.5.2).

Other than in the above-mentioned cases, email has no legal effect in proceedings under the EPC and thus cannot be used to validly perform any procedural act and, in particular, to comply with time limits (see OJ EPO 2000, 458, and A‑VIII, 2.5). If, for instance, shortly before oral proceedings, the applicant would like to submit new requests and/or amended documents, they should do so by electronic filing or fax. Documents submitted via electronic filing are normally visible in the electronic file on the same day.

Examples of situations where exchanges by email may be useful are:

(i)to arrange a date for a consultation

(ii)when, during a consultation, possible amendments to claims are being discussed and the applicant wants to communicate them immediately without submitting them formally

(iii)shortly before oral proceedings to send an electronic copy of amended claims in addition to the official submission made, for example, by fax; this ensures that the examining division gets the documents well in time to prepare for the oral proceedings.

Emails cannot replace an official communication under Art. 94(3).

3.1 Initiation of exchanges by email

3.2 Confidentiality

3.3 Inclusion in the file of any email exchange3.1 Initiation of exchanges by email

Except in cases where it is a valid filing means (see C‑VII, 3 and E‑III, 8.5.2), neither the examiner nor the applicant should use email without having previously agreed to this, e.g. during a consultation. There must be mutual agreement between the examiner and the applicant to such use if the content of the email goes beyond simply arranging of a date for a consultation or oral proceedings. Furthermore, the mere fact that an email address is indicated on a letter head does not mean that the examiner can use it for file-related matters.

If, on the other hand, an examiner receives an email from an applicant concerning procedural requests or addressing substantive issues without previous agreement, this email cannot simply be ignored, but must be dealt with, ensuring that the content is put in the official file (see also T 599/06). A reply should be sent making clear that email is not an official means of communication and that requests should be filed by permitted means (see A‑II, 1.1, A‑II, 1.2 and A‑II, 1.3).3.2 Confidentiality

For non-published applications, confidentiality must be carefully maintained, and substantive matters should not form part of any email correspondence about such applications.3.3 Inclusion in the file of any email exchange

If email is used, it is essential to ensure that email exchanges are properly documented in the file by sending the result of the consultation to the applicant for information with no time limit. This ensures that the exchange is included in the public part of the file and that the applicant is aware of this.

Submissions filed by email during a consultation or during oral proceedings held by videoconference, including all attachments, should be annexed to the minutes (see E‑III, 8.5.2 for details).4. Taking of evidence

4.1 General remark

4.2 Producing evidence

4.3 Written evidence4.1 General remark

The general considerations relating to the taking of evidence are set out in E‑IV. This section deals only with the kind of evidence most likely to arise in pre-grant proceedings (i.e. written evidence).4.2 Producing evidence

An examining division does not, as a general rule, require evidence to be produced. The primary function of the examiner in proceedings before grant is to point out to the applicant any ways in which the application does not meet the requirements of the EPC. If the applicant does not accept the examiner's view, then it is for them to decide whether they wish to produce evidence in support of their case and, if so, what form that evidence should take. The examining division should afford the applicant a reasonable opportunity to produce any evidence that is likely to be relevant.

However, this opportunity should not be given where the examining division is convinced that it would serve no useful purpose or result in undue delay.4.3 Written evidence

Written evidence can include the supply of information or the production of a document or a sworn statement.

For example, to rebut an examiner's allegation of lack of inventive step, the applicant might supply information as to the technical advantages of the invention. Or they might produce a sworn statement, either from themself or from an independent witness, purporting to show that workers in the art have been trying for a long time unsuccessfully to solve the problem with which the invention is concerned or that the invention is a completely new departure in the relevant art.5. Oral proceedings

If a request for oral proceedings, even conditional, was filed before the examining division became responsible for the application (see C‑II, 1), the division must honour the request, even if it was not repeated in examination.

On dealing with new requests filed in reply to a summons to oral proceedings, see C‑IV, 8.

As a rule, oral proceedings in examination proceedings are held by videoconference unless the direct taking of evidence is required or if there are other serious reasons for not doing so, e.g. where an impediment prevents an applicant or representative from participating in oral proceedings held by videoconference. Sweeping objections against the reliability of videoconferencing technology or the non-availability of videoconferencing equipment will, as a rule, not qualify as serious reasons in this regard, nor will the need to consider written evidence (see E‑III, 1.3, OJ EPO 2020, A134 and OJ EPO 2020, A40).

The general considerations relating to oral proceedings are set out in E‑III.6. Examination of observations by third parties

The general considerations relating to observations from third parties are set out in E‑VI, 3.Chapter VIII – Work within the examining division

3. Recommendation to refuse

4. Tasks of the other members of the examining division

5. Further communication with the applicant

6. Decision

7. Enlargement of the examining division; consultation of a legally qualified member1. General remarks

An examining division will normally consist of three technical examiners. However, within the examining division responsible for the application, one member (the first examiner member) will, as a general rule, be entrusted to carry out all substantive examination work up to the point of a decision to grant a patent, issue a summons to oral proceedings or refuse the application. While acting on behalf of the examining division in all communications with the applicant up to that point, this examiner may confer informally with the other members of the division at any time on specific points of doubt or difficulty. The term "examiner" as used in this part of the Guidelines is normally understood to mean the "first" examiner member.

As stated above, the examiner first member may seek the advice of other members of the examining division at any stage in the examination. However, there will come a point when it becomes appropriate for them to refer the case formally to the other members of the examining division. This will be when they consider the case to be in order to proceed to grant or, alternatively, where there seems no possibility of an amendment to overcome their objections or where the applicant has not overcome these objections, and when they consider the case to be in order to proceed to refusal. There are also other circumstances in which reference to the examining division is appropriate, e.g. oral proceedings may be suggested by the examiner or requested by the applicant because an impasse has been reached. In considering whether to refer the application to the division, the examiner should be guided by the principle stated in C‑IV, 3.

Primary examiners The first member should also bear in mind that when they issue a communication they do so in the name of the division, and the applicant is entitled to assume that if the examiner had doubts as to the views of the rest of the division, they would have discussed the matter with them beforehand.

Although the examining division assumes ultimate responsibility for an application as soon as that application passes to it under Rule 10, formal matters are normally dealt with by a formalities officer (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 December 2013, OJ EPO 2014, A6; OJ EPO 2015, A104). Examiners should not spend time checking the work of the Receiving Section or the formalities officer. However, they should refer an application to the formalities officer for further consideration if they believe the formalities report to be incorrect or incomplete.

If required by specific circumstances (e.g. sickness), an application may be reallocated to another examiner/examining division. In such cases, the decision to reallocate will be taken by the line manager. The director is responsible for deciding whether the dossier is to be fully reallocated to a new examining division or whether a single member of the division is to be replaced.

Art. 18(2)2. Recommendation to grant

If the examiner considers that the application satisfies the requirements of the EPC and is thus in order to proceed to grant, they should make a brief written report (the "votum"). As a general rule, the examiner will list in this report the reasons why, in their opinion, the subject-matter as claimed in the application is not obvious having regard to the state of the art. They should normally comment on the document reflecting the nearest prior art and the features of the claimed invention that make it patentable, although there may be exceptional circumstances where this is not necessary, e.g. where patentability is based on a surprising effect. They should also indicate how any apparently obscure but important points have ultimately been clarified, and if there are any borderline questions that the examiner has resolved in favour of the applicant, they should draw attention specifically to these.3. Recommendation to refuse

When referring an application that is not in order for the grant of a patent to the examining division, the examiner first member should confer with the other members of the division, bringing to their attention the points at issue, summarising the case history to the extent necessary to enable them to obtain a quick grasp of the essential facts and recommending the action to be taken, e.g. refusal, or grant conditional upon certain further amendments. As the other members will need to study the case themselves, there is no need for a detailed exposition. It will be useful, however, to draw attention to any unusual features or points not readily apparent from the documents themselves. If the examiner first member recommends refusal and the issue seems clear-cut, they may have a draft reasoned decision ready for issue by the examining division (see C‑V, 14); if the issue is not clear-cut, the drafting of the reasoned decision should be deferred until the division has discussed the case.4. Tasks of the other members of the examining division

When an application is referred to the other members of the division, they will first consider the case individually and each will indicate their opinion on the course of action to be taken. If there is complete agreement with the first examiner's member's recommendation, no further consultation will be necessary. Any further action needed will be entrusted to the first examiner member. If, initially, there is not complete agreement with the first examiner member, or at least one member of the division wishes to discuss the case further, further consultation will be arranged. In such discussions, the division should strive for unanimity, but where this seems unlikely, the difference of opinion must be resolved by voting. When the division is enlarged to four members (see C‑VIII, 7), the chair has a casting vote, where necessary.

The other members of the division should bear in mind that their function is not to completely re-examine the application. If, following a discussion, the first examiner's member's conclusions are generally considered to be reasonable, the other members should accept them.

Art. 18(2)5. Further communication with the applicant

If, in the opinion of the examining division, the application can be amended to bring it into a form that meets the requirements of the EPC, then the first examiner member should be entrusted with informing the applicant of the division's opinion that the application should be refused on certain grounds unless satisfactory amendments are submitted within a stated period (see C‑VI, 1). If, within the time limit, satisfactory amendments are made, the examiner will then report back to the division recommending that the application should proceed to grant. If not, they should report back recommending refusal.

5.1 When can a summons to oral proceedings be issued in substantive examination?5.1 When can a summons to oral proceedings be issued in substantive examination?

At the beginning of substantive examination, if the examining division is of the opinion that the application cannot be granted directly, at least one substantive communication within the meaning of Art. 94(3) will generally be sent before the division issues a summons to oral proceedings (see C‑III, 4).

In particular, neither the search opinion of an EESR or a supplementary search (ESOP) nor an opinion or report from the PCT procedure (WO-ISA, SISR, IPRP or IPER) is a communication under Art. 94(3), so even if the applicant has replied to them, it is not generally appropriate to send a summons as a first communication in European substantive examination.

Nor are the following communications/requests considered as substantive communications from the examining division for this purpose: invitation under Rule 62a or Rule 63, communication under Rule 137(4), request under Rule 53(3), request under Art. 124 and Rule 141, invitation under Rule 164(2)(a).

Exceptionally, a summons to oral proceedings may be issued as the first action in examination proceedings, provided that the criteria set out in C‑III, 5 are met.

In examination proceedings, where the applicant has been invited to provide a translation of the priority according to Rule 53(3) (see A‑III, 6.8.2 and F‑VI, 3.4), no summons to oral proceedings will be issued until either the translation is provided or the period for further processing in respect of the time limit according to Rule 53(3) has expired.

Art. 76(1)6. Decision

All decisions are issued by the examining division as a whole and not by an individual examiner. All members therefore sign the written decision, irrespective of whether it was unanimous. If, exceptionally, one or more division members cannot sign the decision, one of the other members –normally the chair – may sign it on their behalf, subject to the conditions defined in E‑X, 2.3. A seal may replace the signature.

Rule 1137. Enlargement of the examining division; consultation of a legally qualified examiner member

If the examining division deems it necessary given the nature of a decision, it is enlarged to include a legally qualified examiner member. The decision to enlarge or to set aside an enlargement lies with the examining division.

The participation of a legally qualified examiner member or at least internal consultation of Directorate Patent Law and Processes, the unit responsible for providing legally qualified members for examining and opposition divisions, will be required in the event of a difficult legal question not yet solved by the Guidelines or jurisprudence.

The applicant is informed of the division's enlargement in the communication accompanying and/or the annex to the summons or the decision following enlargement, as appropriate. Once the division has been enlarged, communications or decisions must be signed by all four members.

If the examining division has been enlarged to four members, the chair will have a casting vote. As a rule, enlargement will be required in cases involving technical opinions (Art. 25 – see E‑XIII, 3.1) and where evidence has to be taken according to Rule 117 (including the giving of evidence by witnesses – see E‑IV). It is also to be considered in the case of oral proceedings.

Where an examining division has been enlarged pursuant to Art. 18(2) but the case is decided in a three-member composition, there should be clear evidence in the public file that a decision to set aside enlargement was taken by the division in its four-member composition prior to the final decision.

Therefore, if enlargement is considered no longer necessary, the examining division will set it aside. This decision is not separately appealable. The applicant is informed about the setting aside of the enlargement in the communication accompanying and/or the annex to the summons or the decision following the setting aside of the enlargement.

Depending on the nature of the problem, as an alternative to enlarging the examining division, it may be sufficient to consult a legally qualified examiner member in Directorate Patent Law and Processes. For instance, doubts may arise whether an application concerns an invention within the meaning of Art. 52(2) or whether the claimed invention is excluded from patentability by virtue of Art. 53. Such consultation may also be appropriate where legal considerations predominate in a decision, as in proceedings following a request for re-establishment of rights according to Art. 122. Formalities officers may also consult Directorate Patent Law and Processes within the scope of the duties conferred to them under Rule 11(3) (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 December 2013, OJ EPO 2014, A6).

1.4 Examination of a divisional application

1.5 Description and drawings

1.6 Claims1.1 General remarks

A divisional application may be filed subsequent to the filing of a European patent application or on a Euro-PCT application's entry into the European phase. The divisional application is accorded the same filing date as the parent application, which must be pending when the divisional application is filed (A‑IV, 1.1.1), and benefits from any right of priority of the parent application in respect of subject-matter contained in the divisional application. A European patent application may give rise to more than one divisional application, and a divisional application may itself give rise to one or more divisional applications.

Divisional applications are to be treated the same as ordinary applications and are subject to the same requirements unless specific EPC provisions, in particular Art. 76 or Rule 36, require something different (G 1/05, G 1/06).

Furthermore, as soon as the requirements of Rule 36 and Art. 76(1) are fulfilled, the proceedings for grant of a divisional application become separate and independent from the proceedings concerning the parent application (G 4/98). Pending opposition or appeal proceedings concerning the parent application (or any member of that family of applications) do not constitute grounds for staying the examination proceedings for a divisional application, either by the EPO on its own initiative or on request. Reasons for a stay or interruption of proceedings are set out in E‑VII, 1 to E‑VII, 3.

Art. 76(1)1.2 Voluntary and mandatory division

Applicants may file a divisional application of their own volition (voluntary division). The most common reason, however, for filing a divisional application is to meet an objection under Art. 82 due to lack of unity of invention (mandatory division). If the examiner raises an objection due to lack of unity, the applicant is allowed a period (see C‑VI, 1) in which to limit their application to a single invention. The limitation of the parent application has to be clear and unconditional. The communication inviting the applicant to limit the application due to lack of unity should therefore indicate that if not limited within the set time limit the application may be refused.

Art. 821.3 Abandonment of subject-matter

The mere deletion of subject-matter in the parent application is not prejudicial to the later filing of a divisional application. When deleting subject-matter, the applicant should, however, avoid any statements that could be interpreted as abandonment with substantive effect, thereby impeding the valid filing of a divisional application for that subject-matter (see also H‑III, 2.5, last paragraph).1.4 Examination of a divisional application

The substantive examination of a divisional application should in principle be carried out in the same way as for any other application. However, there are a number of special points to be considered (see also C‑III, 5). The claims of a divisional application need not be limited to subject-matter already claimed in the parent application's claims. Furthermore, no abuse of the system of divisional applications can be identified in the mere fact that the claims of the application on which the examining division had then to decide had a broader scope than the claims granted in relation to the parent application (see T 422/07).

However, under Art. 76(1), the subject-matter may not extend beyond the content of the parent application as filed. If a divisional application as filed contains subject-matter additional to that contained in the parent application as filed, it can be amended later so that its subject-matter no longer extends beyond the earlier content, even at a time when the earlier application is no longer pending (see G 1/05). If the applicant is unwilling to remedy the defect by removing that additional subject-matter, the divisional application must be refused under Art. 97(2) for failure to comply with Art. 76(1).

The divisional application cannot be converted into an independent application taking its own filing date. Moreover, a further divisional application for this additional subject-matter should also be refused under Art. 97(2) for failure to comply with Art. 76(1).

Art. 76(1)

Amendments made to a divisional application subsequent to its filing must comply with the requirements of Art. 123(2), i.e. they may not extend the subject-matter beyond the content of the divisional application as filed (see G 1/05 and T 873/94). If the amendments have not been identified and/or their basis in the application as filed not indicated by the applicant (see H‑III, 2.1) and the application is one of those mentioned in H‑III, 2.1.4, the examining division may send a communication under Rule 137(4) requesting the applicant to provide this information (see H‑III, 2.1.1).

If the subject-matter of a divisional application is restricted to only a part of the subject-matter claimed in the parent application, this part must be directly and unambiguously derivable from the parent application as being a separate part or entity, i.e. one that can be used even outside the context of the invention of the parent application (see T 545/92).

In the case of a sequence of applications consisting of a root (originating) application followed by divisional applications, each divided from its predecessor (see A‑IV, 1.1.2), it is a necessary and sufficient condition for a divisional application of that sequence to comply with Art. 76(1), second sentence, that anything disclosed in that divisional application be directly and unambiguously derivable from what is disclosed in each of the preceding applications as filed (see G 1/06).

Art. 123(2)1.5 Description and drawings

The description and drawings of the parent application and the/each divisional application should in principle be confined to matter that is relevant to the invention claimed in that application. However, amendment of the description should be required only where absolutely necessary. Thus, the repetition in a divisional application of matter in the parent application need not be objected to unless it is clearly unrelated to or inconsistent with the invention claimed in the divisional application. As for the matter of cross-references, there is no need for the examiner to check in the description since, under present practice, cross-references are always made between the parent and divisional applications. These appear on the front page of the respective application and patent published after receipt of the divisional application unless the technical preparations for publication have already been completed.1.6 Claims

Parent and divisional applications may not claim the same subject-matter, even in different words (for further information, see G‑IV, 5.4). The difference between the claimed subject-matter of the two applications must be clearly distinguishable. As a general rule, however, one application may claim its own subject-matter in combination with that of the other application. In other words, if the parent and divisional applications claim separate and distinct elements – A and B respectively – that function in combination, one of the two applications may also include a claim for A plus B.2. Applications resulting from a decision under Art. 61

2.1 General remarks

2.2 Original application no longer pending

2.3 Partial entitlement

2.4 Entitlement for certain designated states only2.1 General remarks

In certain circumstances, before a patent has been granted on a particular application, it may be adjudged by a final decision of a national court that a person other than the applicant is entitled to the grant of a patent on it. In this event the third party may either:

(i)prosecute the application as their own application in place of the applicant

Art. 61(1)(a)

(ii)file a new European patent application in respect of the same invention

Art. 61(1)(b)

(iii)request that the application be refused.

If the first of these options is chosen, the third party becomes the applicant in place of the former applicant and the prosecution of the application is continued from the position at which it was interrupted (see also A‑IV, 2).

Art. 61(1)(c)

If, however, the third party files a new application under Art. 61(1)(b), the provisions of Art. 76(1) apply to this new application mutatis mutandis. This means that the new application is treated as though it were a divisional application i.e. it takes the filing date and benefit of any priority right of the original application (see also A‑IV, 1.2). The examiner must therefore ensure that the subject-matter content of the new application does not extend beyond that of the original application as filed. The original application is deemed withdrawn on the new application's filing date for the designated states concerned.

Art. 61(1) and Art. 61(2) Rule 17(1)2.2 Original application no longer pending

In cases where the original application has been withdrawn, refused or deemed withdrawn and is thus no longer pending, Art. 61(1)(b) is applicable, allowing the third party to still file a new European patent application in respect of the same invention (see G 3/92).2.3 Partial entitlement

If, by a final decision, it is adjudged that a third party is entitled to the grant of a European patent in respect of only part of the matter disclosed in the European patent application, then the above considerations apply only to that part. In such a case, option (i) mentioned in C‑IX, 2.1 is not open to the third party and, regarding option C‑IX, 2.1(ii), the new application must be confined to that part of the original subject-matter to which the third party has become entitled. Similarly, the original application must, for the designated states concerned, be confined to the subject-matter to which the original applicant remains entitled. The relationship between the new application and the amended original application will be similar to that between two divisional applications, and the relationship between each of those and the original application will be similar to that between divisional applications and the application from which they are divided. The guidance set out in C‑IX, 1.4, C-IX, 1.5 and C-IX, 1.6 is therefore applicable to this situation.

Rule 18(1)2.4 Entitlement for certain designated states only

Where the final decision on entitlement applies to only certain designated states, the original application may contain different description, claims and drawings for those states compared with the others (see H‑III, 4.1, last paragraph, and H-III, 4.3).

If the sole result of the application of Art. 61(1) is to divide the right to the grant between the original applicant and the third party so that each may apply for the entire subject-matter for different designated states, each application should be examined in the normal way without regard to the other, with the proviso that the subject-matter of each application must not extend beyond that of the original application.

6. Parties to opposition proceedings

7. Representation

8. Information to the public1. The meaning of opposition

The public may oppose a granted European patent on the basis of one or more of the grounds mentioned in Art. 100. The grounds on which the opposition is based may arise for example from circumstances of which the EPO was not aware when the patent was granted (e.g. prior use or a publication which was not contained or not found among the material available to the EPO). Opposition is therefore a means by which any person (but see D‑I, 4) may obtain the limitation or revocation of a wrongly granted patent.2. Opposition after surrender or lapse

An opposition may be filed even if the European patent has been surrendered or has lapsed for all designated states. This is relevant in that in such cases the rights acquired with the patent remain in existence during the period up to surrender or lapse and claims arising from such rights may subsist after that date.

Rule 753. Territorial effect of the opposition

The opposition applies to the European patent in all the contracting states in which that patent has effect. Thus, the opposition has, in principle, to be in respect of all the designated states. If an opposition is filed in respect of only some of the designated states it will be treated as if it were in respect of all the designated states.

Art. 99(2)

Nevertheless, the effect of an opposition may differ as between contracting states. This may arise where the patent contains different claims for different contracting states in accordance with Rule 18(2) (see C‑IX, 2.4), or where the claims must take account of different art under the provisions of Art. 54(3) EPC 1973 and of Art. 54(4) EPC 1973 (see D‑VII, 8). Amendments may also be occasioned by national rights of earlier date within the meaning of Art. 139(2) and Art. 140 (see H‑II, 3.3 and H‑III, 4.4). Thus, the patent may be differently amended in respect of different contracting states and may be revoked in respect of one or more contracting states and not in respect of others.

Art. 61 Art. 139(2), Art. 1404. Entitlement to oppose

"Any person" may give notice of opposition without specifying any particular interest. "Any person" is to be construed in line with Art. 58 as meaning any natural person (private individual, self-employed persons, etc.), any legal person or any body assimilated to a legal person under the law governing it. "Any person" does not include the patent proprietor (see G 9/93, reversing G 1/84).

Notice of opposition may also be filed jointly by more than one of the persons mentioned above. In order to safeguard the rights of the patent proprietor and in the interests of procedural efficiency, it has to be clear throughout the procedure who belongs to the group of common opponents. If a common opponent (including the common representative) intends to withdraw from the proceedings, the EPO must be notified accordingly by the common representative or by a new common representative determined under Rule 151(1) in order for the withdrawal to take effect (see also G 3/99).

Oppositions are not assignable but may be inherited or succeeded to as part of an overall succession in law, e.g. in the event of the merger of legal persons (see G 4/88). Acquiring companies may also take over oppositions filed by acquired companies. However, a legal person who was a subsidiary of the opponent when the opposition was filed and who carries on the business to which the opposed patent relates cannot acquire the status of opponent if all its shares are assigned to another company (see G 2/04).

The European Patent Office has to examine, ex officio, the validity of any purported transfer of opponent status to a new party at all stages of the proceedings (see T 1178/04).

Art. 99(1)5. Intervention of the assumed infringer

Under certain conditions (see D‑VII, 6) third parties who prove that proceedings for infringement of the opposed patent have been instituted against them or that the patent proprietor has requested them to cease alleged infringement of the patent and that they have instituted proceedings for a court ruling that they are not infringing the patent may, after the opposition period has expired, intervene in the opposition proceedings. If the notice of intervention is filed in good time and in due form, the intervention is to be treated as an opposition (see D‑IV, 5.6). For accelerated processing of oppositions on request, see D‑VII, 1.2 and E‑VIII, 5.

Art. 105(1) and Art. 105(2) Rule 896. Parties to opposition proceedings

The patent proprietor, the opponent(s) and, where applicable, the intervener(s) will be parties to the opposition proceedings. However, an opponent who has withdrawn their opposition or whose opposition has been rejected as inadmissible will remain a party to the proceedings only until the date of such withdrawal or the date on which the decision on rejection has become final. The same will apply in the case of interveners. Third parties who have presented observations concerning the patentability of the invention in respect of which an application has been filed are not parties to opposition proceedings (see E‑VI, 3).

Art. 99(3) Art. 105(2) Art. 115

Where the patent proprietors are not the same in respect of different designated contracting states, they are to be regarded as joint patent proprietors for the purposes of opposition proceedings (see D‑VII, 3.1 concerning the unity of the European patent).

Art. 118

Where evidence has been provided that in a contracting state, following a final decision, a person has been entered in the patent register of that state instead of the previous patent proprietor, this person is entitled on request to replace the previous patent proprietor in respect of that state. In this event, by derogation from Art. 118, the previous patent proprietor and the person making the request are not deemed to be joint patent proprietors unless both so request. The aim of this provision is to afford new patent proprietors the opportunity of defending themselves against the opposition as they see fit (see D‑VII, 3.2 as regards the conduct of the opposition proceedings in such cases).

Art. 99(4) Art. 61(1)(a)

The Legal Division is responsible for decisions in respect of entries in the Register of European Patents (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 21 November 2013, OJ EPO 2013, 600).

It is to be noted that a person who files two different notices of opposition to the same granted patent acquires party status as opponent only once (T 9/00). Two filings by the same opponent within the opposition period that individually are not admissible but taken together comply with Art. 99(1) and Rule 76 are considered as one admissible opposition (T 774/05; for a joint opposition, see D‑I, 4).

Multiple oppositions are dealt with in a single set of proceedings (see E‑III, 6). When there are multiple opponents and/or proprietors as parties to a single opposition proceedings, it is normally appropriate to deal with all relevant issues (including e.g. admissibility of one of the oppositions, see D‑IV, 5.5) when taking the final decision, e.g. during one oral proceedings (also see E‑III, 6). The legal framework is defined by the sum of the statements of the extent to which the patent is opposed and by the grounds for opposition submitted and substantiated in the notices of opposition provided by each opponent. If one of the oppositions is admissible, but is later withdrawn, prejudicial grounds put forward in said opposition are generally examined by the opposition division of its own motion. If one of the oppositions is inadmissible, and provided at least one admissible opposition has been filed, the opposition division will consider of its own motion any prima facie relevant art cited in the inadmissible opposition (see D‑V, 2.2).

Art. 20(1)7. Representation

As regards the requirements relating to representation of opponents and patent proprietors, reference is made to A‑VIII, 1. Deficiencies in the representation of an opponent when filing the opposition and their remedy are dealt with in D‑IV, 1.2.1(ii) and D-IV, 1.2.2.2(iv).8. Information to the public

As soon as an opposition has been received, the date of filing of the opposition is entered in the Register of European Patents and published in the European Patent Bulletin. The same applies to the date on which opposition proceedings are concluded and to the outcome of the proceedings (see also A‑XI, 4).Chapter II – The opposition division

Rule 11(1)2. Composition

2.1 Technically qualified members

2.2 Legally qualified members

2.3 Chair2.1 Technically qualified members examiners

An opposition division consists of three technically qualified members examiners, at least two of whom must not have taken part in the proceedings for grant of the patent to which the opposition relates.

Participation in the proceedings for grant of the patent to which the opposition relates includes, in particular, performing a procedural act such as issuing a communication or signing a summons to oral proceedings. However, participation in the proceedings of a patent family member, e.g. a parent or priority application of the opposed patent, is not considered as participation in the proceedings for grant of the patent to which the opposition relates for the purposes of Art. 19(2).

Art. 19(2)2.2 Legally qualified members examiners

If the opposition division considers that the nature of the decision so requires, it is enlarged by the addition of a legally qualified member examiner who has not taken part in the proceedings for grant.

The principles established for inclusion of a legally qualified member and for consultation of the Directorate Patent Law, the department responsible for providing legally qualified members for examining and opposition divisions, by the examining division apply mutatis mutandis to the opposition division (see C‑VIII, 7). Difficult legal questions may also arise during the examination as to whether an opposition is to be rejected as inadmissible. In addition, consultation of a legally qualified member is to be envisaged in cases where it is questionable whether or not a disclosure by means other than a document was made available to the public.

Art. 19(2)2.3 Chair

The chair must be a technically qualified member examiner who has not taken part in the grant proceedings (see D‑II, 2.1).3. Allocation of duties and appointment of members of the opposition division

C‑II, 2 applies mutatis mutandis.

Rule 11(1)4. Tasks of the opposition divisions

4.1 Examination of oppositions

4.2 Decision concerning the awarding of costs by the opposition division

4.3 Ancillary proceedings4.1 Examination of oppositions

The opposition divisions are responsible for the examination of oppositions against European patents.

The examination of newly submitted documents for compliance with physical requirements will essentially be the task of the competent formalities officers (see D‑II, 7, A‑I, 2, A‑III, 3.2 and C‑VIII, 1).

Art. 19(1)4.2 Decision concerning the awarding of costs by the opposition division

The opposition division will decide on requests to have the costs fixed by the formalities officer reviewed (see D‑II, 7 and D‑IX, 2.1).

Art. 104(2) Rule 88(3) and Rule 88(4)4.3 Ancillary proceedings

It will be incumbent upon the opposition division to conduct ancillary proceedings arising in the course of opposition proceedings. Such ancillary proceedings may for example concern a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of a time limit which was not observed vis-à-vis the EPO during the opposition proceedings, a request for a decision concerning a finding arrived at by the formalities officer that a right has been lost or a request for exclusion from file inspection. Additional tasks may be entrusted to the opposition divisions by the President of the EPO in accordance with Rule 11(2).

Art. 122(2) Rule 136(4) Rule 112(2)

As regards exclusion from file inspection pursuant to Rule 144 in conjunction with the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, J.3, reference is made to A‑XI, 2.1. Documents having a substantive and/or procedural bearing on opposition proceedings can only exceptionally be excluded from file inspection (T 1691/15). Communications dealing with a request for exclusion from file inspection are excluded from file inspection and are issued separately from communications dealing with other issues. Depending on its content, a document (provisionally) excluded from file inspection and any communication concerning a request for its exclusion from file inspection may be forwarded to the other party or parties (Rule 81(2)). As the public must be informed of the grounds prejudicing or supporting the maintenance of an opposed patent, only documents, or parts thereof, not (provisionally) excluded from file inspection can be used as evidence to prove or to refute a ground for opposition.

If a party requests that the EPO excludes an otherwise public nonpatent literature document from file inspection for reasons of copyright, the opposition division will interpret this as a request not to make the document available to third parties in the public part of the file. This request, in the above interpretation, is normally granted if the copyright of the document in question is not owned by a party to the proceedings and the document in question is relatively easily retrievable including against payment. For example, a scientific article is usually easily retrievable, and its copyright is assigned to the editor. In contrast, a third-party company brochure is not easily retrievable. If the copyright of such company brochure is owned by a party to the proceedings, the request is refused by the opposition division and the document is made available via file inspection.

Where the request not to make a document available via file inspection for reasons of copyright is acceded to by the opposition division, the page(s) carrying the bibliographic details of the non-patent literature document (normally the cover page) will nonetheless be made available via file inspection in order to ensure that members of the public are in a position to retrieve the entire document. The nonpatent literature document is not considered as being excluded from file inspection within the meaning of Rule 144 and can be used as evidence in the opposition proceedings.

Rule 1445. Allocation of tasks to members

An opposition division will normally entrust one of its members with the examination of the opposition, but not with the conduct of oral proceedings, up to the time of the final decision on the opposition (see also D‑IV, 2). If need be, the same member may also be entrusted with the examination of the evidence adduced (see E‑IV, 1.3). This member will be referred to as the first member primary examiner.

Art. 19(2) Rule 119(1)6. Duties and powers of members

The first member primary examiner will conduct the examination of the opposition. If oral proceedings have been requested, they are normally arranged as first action, possibly in conjunction with the taking of evidence (see E‑III, 1 to E‑III, 4 and E‑IV, 1.6.1). The first member primary examiner will prepare the communication accompanying the summons to oral proceedings and submit it to the other members. If the first member primary examiner considers that communications to the parties preceding the summons for oral proceedings are necessary, these communications will be submitted to the opposition division before despatch.

If there are differences of opinion within the opposition division, the first member primary examiner will confer with the other members to discuss the points at issue. The chair will preside at the meeting and, following a discussion, will take a vote on the decision or the further course of the procedure.

Voting will be on the basis of a simple majority. In the event of parity of votes, the vote of the chair of the division is decisive.

Any further measures necessary will as a rule be entrusted to the first member primary examiner. If no further measures are necessary, the first member primary examiner will draft a decision on the opposition and will distribute the draft to the other members of the opposition division for examination and signature. If any changes are proposed by a member and there are differences of opinion on such changes, the chair must arrange a meeting.

Where reference is made hereinafter to the opposition division, this is to be taken to mean the first member primary examiner where such a member has been appointed and in so far as the EPC entitles an opposition division member to act alone.

Art. 19(2)7. Allocation of individual duties

The President of the EPO may entrust to employees who are not technically or legally qualified examiners the execution of individual duties falling to the examining divisions or to the opposition divisions and involving no technical or legal difficulties. In so far as such duties affect the public, their allocation will be notified in the Official Journal of the EPO (see decisions of the President of the EPO dated 12 December 2013, OJ EPO 2014, A6, and 23 November 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A104).

The formalities officers entrusted with these duties are also in charge of fixing the amount of the costs (see D‑IX, 2.1).

Within nine months from the publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent, notice of opposition has to be given to the EPO in Munich, The Hague or Berlin.

For expiry of the time limit see E‑VIII, 1.4. Re-establishment of rights in respect of unobserved time limits for opposition is not possible in the case of an opponent (see, however, E‑VIII, 3.1.2).

Art. 99(1)2. Opposition fee

The amount of the opposition fee specified in the Rules relating to Fees under the EPC must be paid before expiry of the time limit for opposition.

An opposition filed in common by two or more persons, which otherwise meets the requirements of Art. 99 and Rules 3 and Rule 76, is admissible on payment of only one opposition fee (see G 3/99).

As regards the legal consequences and the procedure where the fee is not paid in good time, see D‑IV, 1.2.1(i) and D-IV, 1.4.1.

The notice of opposition must be filed in writing and must be typewritten or printed, with a margin of about 2.5 cm on the left-hand side of each page. It would be appropriate if the notice of opposition also satisfied the requirements laid down in Rule 49(2) in conjunction with the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 (OJ EPO 2022, A113).

Notice of opposition may, without prejudice to other means of filing, be filed in electronic form using EPO Online Filing (OLF) or Online Filing 2.0 . However, it may not be filed using the EPO webform filing service (OJ EPO 2021, A42).3.3 Notices of opposition filed by fax

Notice of opposition may also be filed by fax (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 20 February 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A18). At the invitation of the EPO, written confirmation reproducing the contents of the fax and complying with the requirements of the Implementing Regulations – in particular properly signed – must be supplied. If the opponent fails to comply with this invitation in due time, the fax is deemed not to have been received (see A‑VIII, 2.5). The opposition fee must in any case be paid within the opposition period.

Rule 23.4 Signature of the notice of opposition

The notice of opposition must be signed by the person responsible, i.e. by the opponent or, where appropriate, by the representative (see also D‑IV, 1.2.1(ii), and A‑VIII, 1).

Initials or other abbreviated forms will not be accepted as a signature.

Where the notice of opposition is filed in electronic form, the signature may take the form of a facsimile signature or a text string signature (i.e. a type-written signature that is preceded and followed by a forward slash (/)). Where EPO Online Filing is used, the signature may also take the form of an enhanced electronic signature (see OJ EPO 2023, A48 OJ EPO 2021, A42).

Where the notice of opposition is filed by fax, the reproduction on the facsimile of the signature of the person filing the notice of opposition will be considered sufficient.

If the signature is omitted, the formalities officer must request the party, or where appropriate the representative, to affix their signature within a time limit to be laid down by the formalities officer. If signed in due time, the document retains its original date of receipt; otherwise, it is deemed not to have been received (see D‑IV, 1.2.1(ii) and D-IV, 1.4.1).

Rule 50(3) Rule 24. Derogations from language requirements

Derogations from language requirements for written opposition proceedings are dealt with in A‑VII, 3 (for documents filed as evidence, see A‑VII, 3.4) and for oral opposition proceedings in E‑V.5. Grounds for opposition

A written reasoned statement of the grounds for opposition must be filed within the opposition period.

Art. 99(1) Rule 76(1)

Opposition may only be filed on the grounds that:

Art. 100

(i)the subject-matter of the European patent is not patentable under Art. 52 to Art. 57, because it

– is not new (Art. 52(1), Art. 54, Art. 55),

– does not involve an inventive step (Art. 52(1), Art. 56),

– is not susceptible of industrial application (Art. 52(1), Art. 57),

– is not regarded as an invention under Art. 52(1) to Art. 52(3), or

– is not patentable under Art. 53;

Art. 100(a)

(ii)the European patent does not disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art (see Art. 83);

Art. 100(b)

(iii)the subject-matter of the European patent extends beyond the content of the application as filed (see Art. 123(2)) or, if the patent was granted on a divisional application or on a new application filed under Art. 61 (new application in respect of the invention by the person adjudged in a final decision to be entitled to the grant of a European patent), beyond the content of the earlier application as filed (see Art. 76(1)).

(See also D‑V, 3, D‑V, 4 and D‑V, 6 and C‑IV).

Note that each single condition mentioned above forms an individual legal basis for objection to the maintenance of the patent. Consequently, each such condition is to be regarded as a separate ground for opposition (see G 1/95 and G 7/95).

The following allegations, for example, do not constitute grounds for opposition: that national rights of earlier date exist which put the patentability of the invention in question (see, however, H‑III, 4.4), that the patent proprietor is not entitled to the European patent, that the subject-matter of the patent lacks unity, that the claims are not supported by the description (unless it is also argued that the claims are so broadly worded that the description in the specification does not sufficiently disclose the subject-matter within the meaning of Art. 100(b)), that the form and content of the description or drawings of the patent do not comply with the provisions as to formal requirements as set forth in Rules 42 and Rule 49(2) in conjunction with the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 (OJ EPO 2022, A113), or that the designation of the inventor is incorrect. Nor does the simple allegation that priority has been wrongly claimed constitute a ground for opposition. However, the matter of priority must be subjected to a substantial examination in the course of opposition proceedings if prior art is invoked in connection with a ground for opposition under Art. 100(a) in relation to which the priority date is of decisive importance (see G‑IV, 3 and F‑VI, 2).

Art. 100(c)6. Content of the notice of opposition

The notice of opposition, filed in a written reasoned statement, must contain:

(i)the name, address and nationality of the opponent and the state in which the opponent's residence or principal place of business is located. Names of natural persons must be indicated by the person's family name and given name(s), the family name being indicated before the given name(s). Names of legal entities, as well as companies considered to be legal entities by reason of the legislation to which they are subject, must be indicated by their official designations. Addresses must be indicated in such a way as to satisfy the customary requirements for prompt postal delivery at the indicated address. They must comprise all the relevant administrative units, including the house number, if any. Opponents (whether natural or legal persons) whose residence or principal place of business is in an EPC contracting state and who act without a professional representative can use an address for correspondence other than their residence. The address for correspondence must be the opponent's own address. Post cannot be sent to a different (natural or legal) person, since that requires a valid form of representation under Art. 133 and Art. 134. It is recommended that the telephone number and fax numbers be indicated (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.2(i) and D‑IV, 1.4.2);

Rule 76(2)(a) Rule 41(2)(c)

(ii)the number of the European patent against which opposition is filed, the name of the patent proprietor and the title of the invention (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.2(ii) and D-IV, 1.4.2);

(iii)a statement of the extent to which the European patent is opposed and of the grounds on which the opposition is based as well as an indication of the facts and evidence presented in support of these grounds (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.1(iii) to D-IV, 1.2.2.1(v) and D-IV, 1.4.2). The requirement under Rule 76(1) that notice of opposition must be filed in a written reasoned statement also implies presenting arguments. However, in order to streamline opposition procedure, it is recommended that a single copy of any written evidence be submitted as soon as possible and ideally with the notice of opposition (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.1(v), last two paragraphs);

1.5 Notifications to and observations by the patent proprietor

1.6 Subsequent procedure1.1 Forwarding of the notice of opposition to the formalities officer

The notice of opposition must be forwarded directly to the formalities officer, who then places it in the electronic file of the European patent concerned in accordance with the relevant administrative instructions and communicates it without delay to the patent proprietor for information. If a notice of opposition is received prior to the publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent, the formalities officer informs the senders that their document cannot be treated as an opposition. This document becomes part of the file and, as such, is also available for inspection under Art. 128(4), and is brought to the attention of the applicant or the patent proprietor as an observation by a third party in accordance with Art. 115 (for details, see E‑VI, 3). If an opposition fee has been paid, it will in this case be refunded.

Examinations, observations, communications and, where appropriate, invitations to the parties will be the responsibility of the formalities officer who has been entrusted with this task of the opposition division (see D‑II, 7).1.2 Examination for deficiencies in the notice of opposition

After notice of opposition has been given, the formalities officer examines whether any deficiencies exist.

1.2.1 Deficiencies which, if not remedied, lead to the opposition being deemed not to have been filed

1.2.2 Deficiencies which, if not remedied, lead to the opposition being rejected as inadmissible1.2.1 Deficiencies which, if not remedied, lead to the opposition being deemed not to have been filed

The following deficiencies fall into this category:

(i)the opposition fee or a sufficient amount of the fee has not been paid within the opposition period (Art. 99(1); see also G 1/18). However, if the opposition fee, apart from a small amount (e.g. deducted as bank charges), has been paid within the opposition period, the formalities officer examines whether the amount lacking can be overlooked where this is justified. If the formalities officer concludes that the amount lacking can be overlooked, the opposition fee is deemed to have been paid and there is no deficiency in the present sense;

(ii)the document giving notice of opposition is not signed and this is not rectified within the period set by the formalities officer, which is fixed at two months as a rule (see E‑VIII, 1.2) (Rule 50(3)).

It is noted that for cases covered by Art. 133(2) (see also D‑IV, 1.2.2.2(iv)) a professional representative first has to be appointed within the prescribed time limit. The above applies if the appointed representative then fails to remedy such deficiency either by signing the notice or by approving it in writing;

(iii)where a notice of opposition is filed by fax and written confirmation reproducing the contents of the fax, if requested by the formalities officer, is not supplied in due time (Rule 2(1) and decision of the President of the EPO dated 20 February 2019, OJ EPO 2019, A18);

(iv)where a notice of opposition is filed by the representative or employee of an opponent, and the authorisation, if any is required (see A‑VIII, 1.5 and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, L.1), is not supplied in due time (Rule 152(1) to Rule 152(3) and Rule 152(6)); and

(v)the opposition is submitted within the opposition period but not in an official language of the EPO, as specified in Rule 3(1), or if Art. 14(4) applies to the opponent, the translation of the elements referred to in Rule 76(2)(c) is not submitted within the opposition period (see also A‑VII, 2, G 6/91 and T 193/87). This period is extended where the one-month period as required under Rule 6(2) expires later. This deficiency is present if the opposition is not filed in English, French or German or if, for example, an opponent from Belgium files an opposition in time in Dutch but fails to file the translation of the essential elements into English, French or German within the abovementioned time limits.

For oppositions which, upon submission, are deemed not to have been filed because of deficiencies as described above, see the further procedure as described in D‑IV, 1.3.1, D-IV, 1.3.3 and D-IV, 1.4.1.

Art. 7 RFees Art. 8 RFees1.2.2 Deficiencies which, if not remedied, lead to the opposition being rejected as inadmissible

Only such oppositions as are deemed to have been filed will be examined for deficiencies under Rule 77(1) and Rule 77(2).

If the formalities officers are not sure whether the opposition in question contains a deficiency under Rule 76(2)(c), they will submit the file to the opposition division for checking. They will do this in particular if the opposition alleges non-patentability under Art. 52, Art. 54 or Art. 56 and the relevant prior art has been made available to the public by means other than by written description, or if taking of evidence has been requested in accordance with Rule 117.

In this connection the opposition division will also examine the extent to which it is necessary for the formalities officer to request the opponent to submit evidence (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.1(v)).

1.2.2.1 Deficiencies under Rule 77(1)

1.2.2.2 Deficiencies under Rule 77(2)1.2.2.1 Deficiencies under Rule 77(1)

The following deficiencies fall into this category:

(i)the notice of opposition is not filed in writing with the EPO in Munich or its branch at The Hague or its suboffice in Berlin within the nine-month opposition period, calculated from the date of publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent in the European Patent Bulletin (Art. 99(1));

Accordingly, the opposition is deficient if, for example, notice of opposition is submitted to the EPO belatedly, i.e. after expiry of the nine-month period, or where the opposition is notified within the opposition period but only verbally in a telephone call officially noted in the files. This category of deficiency also includes oppositions which, notwithstanding Art. 99(1), are filed with the central industrial property office of a contracting state or an authority thereunder and not forwarded by these offices either at all or in time for them to be received by the EPO before the expiry of the opposition period. There is no legal obligation upon these offices or authorities to forward oppositions to the EPO.

(ii)the notice of opposition does not provide sufficient identification of the European patent against which opposition is filed;

Such a deficiency exists if the EPO is unable to identify the relevant patent on the basis of the particulars in the notice of opposition; for example, if only the proprietor of the contested patent and perhaps the title of the invention for which the patent was granted are mentioned in the notice of opposition. Such particulars alone are not an adequate description of the contested European patent, unless the patent proprietor who alone is named possesses only one patent or possesses several patents, the subject-matter of only one of which fits the title of the invention given in the notice of opposition, being clearly distinct from the subject-matter of the other patents which this proprietor holds. A mere indication of the number of the contested European patent in the notice of opposition constitutes sufficient identification of the patent concerned, provided that no conflicting information is given, e.g. an inconsistent name for the patent proprietor, and the conflict cannot be resolved from the information given.

(iii)the notice of opposition contains no statement of the extent to which the European patent is opposed;

Such a deficiency is present if it is not clear from the requisite statement whether the opposition is directed against the entire subject-matter of the patent or only a part of it, i.e. whether it is directed against all the claims or only against one or a part of one claim, such as an alternative or embodiment;

Rule 76(2)(c)

(iv)the notice of opposition contains no statement of the grounds on which the opposition is based;

A notice of opposition contains such a deficiency if it does not mention at least one of the grounds for opposition referred to in Art. 100 (see D‑III, 5). If non-patentability is given as a ground for opposition, the statement of grounds must at least implicitly indicate which conditions for patentability (Art. 52 to Art. 57) are considered not to have been fulfilled.

Rule 76(2)(c)

(v)the notice of opposition is not adequately substantiated;

According to Rule 76(2)(c), a notice of opposition has to contain a statement of the extent to which the European patent is opposed, the grounds on which the opposition is based, as well as an indication of the facts and evidence presented in support of these grounds for opposition.

The wording of Rule 76(2)(c) clearly indicates that there is a difference between the grounds for opposition, i.e. the legal basis for revocation of the patent (e.g. Art. 100(a)), and the facts and evidence presented in support of these grounds. Where the facts and evidence are entirely absent or so vague as not to allow a proper understanding of the case, the opposition is considered to contain only a mere allegation, which is not sufficient to render the opposition admissible.

Therefore, the opponent has to substantiate the grounds for opposition by adducing facts, evidence and arguments for at least one of those grounds. The opponent has to establish the legal and factual framework on which the opposition rests to pave the way for a substantive assessment. As a consequence, the division and the patent proprietor need to be able to understand, without further investigation of their own, the issues that need to be decided. It is not necessary for the admissibility of the opposition that a final decision can be taken without further investigation. In other words, it is not a question of admissibility but of substantive examination whether the facts on which the opponent relies in comprehensibly explaining a ground for opposition are or can be proven.

Where the grounds comprise an allegation of a prior use or an oral disclosure prior to the date of filing or the priority date, the opposition division must be supplied with an indication of the facts, evidence and arguments necessary to determine

(a)the date on which the alleged use occurred ("when"),

(b)what was used ("what"),

(c)and the circumstances relating to the use ("where, how, by whom") (G‑IV, 7.2 and 7.3).

Where there are multiple grounds for opposition, if the facts, evidence and arguments for one ground are sufficiently indicated, the opposition is admissible even if the facts, evidence and arguments in support of the other grounds are submitted belatedly. Such belated facts, evidence and arguments are in that event dealt with in accordance with E‑VI, 2. Owing to the length of the opposition period (nine months), however, in order to expedite the opposition proceedings, it is recommended that a single copy of any written evidence indicated in the notice of opposition be submitted as soon as possible and ideally with the notice of opposition.

Art. 99(1) Rule 76(2)(c)

Otherwise, if the opposition is admissible, the opponent will be invited to supply such evidence as soon as possible and as a rule within two months. If the documents thus requested are neither enclosed nor filed within the time limit set, the opposition division may decide not to take into account any arguments based on them. (As regards facts or evidence not submitted in due time and arguments presented at a late stage see E‑VI, 2).

As far as the admissibility of an opposition is concerned, it is immaterial whether and to what extent the facts, evidence and arguments submitted in due time actually warrant revocation of the contested European patent or its maintenance in amended form. On the one hand, an unconvincing ground for opposition may have been substantiated (making the opposition admissible), whereas on the other hand a deficient submission may have been rejected as inadmissible even though, if properly drafted, it could have succeeded (see also T 222/85).

The substantiation of the grounds for opposition thus has to be clearly distinguished from the actual assessment of the evidence, which is part of the process of ascertaining whether the opposition is well-founded in substance, i.e. proven. Subject to the admissibility of the opposition, this has to be established by the opposition division in the light of the applicable standard of proof (G‑IV, 7.5.2).

Rule 76(2)(c) Rule 83

(vi)the opposition does not indicate beyond any doubt the identity of the person filing the opposition (Art. 99(1) and Rule 76(2)(a)).

Art. 99(1) Rule 76(2)(a)1.2.2.2 Deficiencies under Rule 77(2)

The following deficiencies fall within this category:

(i)the notice of opposition does not specify the name, address and nationality of the opponent and the state in which the opponent's residence or principal place of business is located in the prescribed manner (see D‑III, 6(i));

Rule 76(2)(a)

(ii)the number of the European patent against which the opposition is filed or the name of the patent proprietor or the title of the invention is not indicated;

Each of the particulars listed in (ii) above must be supplied within the time limit set by the formalities officer (see D‑IV, 1.3.2), even if the contested European patent may be identified by means of one of these or other particulars within the opposition period (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.1(ii)). If the name of the patent proprietor as indicated by the opponent is not the same as that recorded in the Register, the formalities officer will inform the opponent of the patent proprietor's correct name.

Rule 76(2)(b)

(iii)where the opponent has appointed a representative, the name or the address of the place of business of such representative is not indicated in the notice of opposition in the prescribed manner (see D‑III, 6(iv));

(iv)the opponent has neither residence nor principal place of business in one of the contracting states (Art. 133(2)) and has not communicated the appointment of a professional representative (Art. 134). In the communication requesting remedy of such deficiency the opponent must also be asked to arrange for the signature or approval of the notice of opposition by the representative to be appointed; and

Rule 76(2)(d)

(v)the notice of opposition fails to satisfy further formal requirements other than those mentioned in Rule 77(1). For instance, it may fail to comply with the provisions of Rule 50(2) without due justification.

Rule 861.3 Issue of communications by the formalities officer as a result of examination for deficiencies

If, in the course of the examination as described in D‑IV, 1.2, formalities officers note deficiencies which may still be remedied, and if there are no deficiencies which may no longer be remedied (in the case of deficiencies which may no longer be remedied see D‑IV, 1.4), they will issue the communications described in D‑IV, 1.3.1 and/or D-IV, 1.3.2 to the opponent, if possible in a single communication.

Art. 14(4) Rule 2(1) Rule 3(1) Rule 6(2) Rule 50(3) Rule 77(1) and Rule 77(2) Rule 152(1) to Rule 152(3)

1.3.1 Communication in the event of deficiencies as described in D‑IV, 1.2.1 which, if not remedied, will lead to the opposition being deemed not to have been filed

1.3.2 Communication in the event of deficiencies as described in D‑IV, 1.2.2 which, if not remedied, will lead to rejection of the opposition as inadmissible

1.3.3 Extent of the formalities officer's obligation to issue the above communications1.3.1 Communication in the event of deficiencies as described in D‑IV, 1.2.1 which, if not remedied, will lead to the opposition being deemed not to have been filed

The communication will indicate the deficiencies noted in accordance with D‑IV, 1.2.1 and will state that the opposition will be deemed not to have been filed unless the deficiency or deficiencies are remedied within the time limits indicated in D‑IV, 1.2.1.1.3.2 Communication in the event of deficiencies as described in D‑IV, 1.2.2 which, if not remedied, will lead to rejection of the opposition as inadmissible

The communication will indicate the deficiencies noted in accordance with D‑IV, 1.2.2.1 or D-IV, 1.2.2.2 and will state that the opposition will be rejected as inadmissible unless the deficiencies as described in D‑IV, 1.2.2.1 are remedied within the opposition period and unless the deficiencies as described in D‑IV, 1.2.2.2 are remedied within the period stipulated by the formalities officer.1.3.3 Extent of the formalities officer's obligation to issue the above communications

Although formalities officers are not obliged to do so, they may notify the opponent of deficiencies as described in D‑IV, 1.2.1(i) and D‑IV, 1.2.2.1 in good time before the expiry of the time limits within which it is still possible to remedy the deficiencies. However, the opponent can seek no legal remedy against failure to issue these communications, which is to be regarded merely as a service afforded the opponent by the EPO so as largely to obviate any adverse legal consequences. Deficiencies as described in D‑IV, 1.2.1(ii) and D-IV, 1.2.2.2 must in any event be officially notified to the opponent, since this is a statutory requirement. Should this communication inadvertently be omitted notwithstanding deficiencies of this type in the notice of opposition, opponents may submit the missing particulars on their own initiative at any time, even after the expiry of the opposition period without suffering adverse legal consequences.1.4 Subsequent procedure in the event of deficiencies which may no longer be remedied

1.4.1 Deficiencies which may no longer be remedied, as a result of which the opposition is deemed not to have been filed

1.4.2 Deficiencies which may no longer be remedied in accordance with Rule 77(1) and (2), resulting in the opposition being rejected as inadmissible1.4.1 Deficiencies which may no longer be remedied, as a result of which the opposition is deemed not to have been filed

If formalities officers establish that the deficiencies referred to in D‑IV, 1.2.1 have not been remedied within the time limits laid down in the EPC or by the EPO, they will inform the opponent in accordance with Art. 119 that the notice of opposition is deemed not to have been filed and that a decision may be applied for under Rule 112(2) (see E‑VIII, 1.9.3). If no such application is made within the prescribed period of two months after notification of this communication, and if there is no other valid opposition pending, the proceedings are closed and the parties informed accordingly. Any opposition fees which have been paid are refunded.

Documents submitted with a notice of opposition which is deemed not to have been filed will form part of the file and will thus be available for inspection in accordance with Art. 128(4). They will be regarded as observations by third parties under Art. 115 (see in this connection D‑V, 2.2 and E‑VI, 3). If a further admissible opposition is pending, the proceedings are continued in respect of it.

Rule 112(1)1.4.2 Deficiencies which may no longer be remedied in accordance with Rule 77(1) and Rule 77(2), resulting in the opposition being rejected as inadmissible

If there are no deficiencies of the type referred to in D‑IV, 1.4.1 but a notice of opposition which is deemed to have been filed reveals deficiencies under Rule 77(1) (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.1) which may no longer be remedied and which have not been communicated to the opponent(s) in accordance with D‑IV, 1.3.2 (because the opposition period has already expired), the formalities officer must, by virtue of Art. 113(1), notify the opponent(s) of these deficiencies, allowing them time in which to submit comments (normally two months), and point out to them that the notice of opposition is likely to be rejected as inadmissible.

If the opponent

–does not successfully refute the opinion expressed by the formalities officer on the existence of deficiencies under Rule 77(1) that which may no longer be corrected or

–has have failed to remedy in good time deficiencies which that may be corrected (Rule 77(2)) and which that were communicated to them pursuant to D‑IV, 1.3.2,

the formalities officer will reject the notice of opposition as inadmissible, except in the case mentioned in D‑IV, 1.2.2.1(v) (for which the opposition division is competent to decide, see the decisions of the President of the EPO dated 12 December 2013 and 23 November 2015 concerning the entrustment to non-examining staff of certain duties incumbent on the examining or opposition divisions, OJ EPO 2014, A6, and OJ EPO 2015, A104). As regards the form of the decision, see E‑X, 2.3 and E‑X, 2.6.

However, if the opponent has requested oral proceedings or a further admissible opposition is pending, In all other cases the formalities officer will submit the opposition documents to the directorate responsible for the European patent in suit (for designation of an opposition division, see D‑IV, 2).

The decision declaring the opposition inadmissible under Rule 77(1) or Rule 77(2) can be taken without the participation of the patent proprietor in accordance with Rule 77(3). However, for reasons of procedural economy, the substantive examination is in fact initiated if at least one further admissible opposition is pending. The patent proprietor may also comment on the admissibility of the former opposition in the course of that examination.

When the decision declaring the opposition inadmissible has become final the opponent concerned is no longer a party to the proceedings.1.5 Notifications to and observations by the patent proprietor

Communications and decisions in the course of the examination as to whether the opposition is deemed to have been filed and is admissible are also notified to the patent proprietors for information. They may file observations on their own initiative concerning such a communication.1.6 Subsequent procedure

For the subsequent procedure in the event of one or more oppositions with no deficiencies see D‑IV, 5.2.2. Activity of the opposition division

Formalities officers submit the file to the opposition division in question on despatch of the invitation to the proprietor to submit comments in the cases referred to in D‑IV, 5.2; in all other cases (see D‑IV, 1.4.2) they submit it immediately.

The director responsible will then designate the three technical members of the competent opposition division. The opposition division will decide whether one of its members – and if so, which – is to be entrusted with the examination of the opposition up to the taking of a decision (see D‑II, 5). The technical members of the division will not be designated if the opposition is rejected as inadmissible by the formalities officer and no further admissible opposition has been filed (see D‑IV, 1.4.2).

Art. 19(2)3. Rejection of the opposition as inadmissible by the opposition division, the patent proprietor not being a party

(For rejection of the opposition as inadmissible at a later stage, the patent proprietor being a party, see D‑IV, 5.1 and D-IV, 5.5).

In cases of insufficient substantiation, where the formalities officer is not competent to decide on the inadmissibility (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.1(v)), the opposition division will either:

(i)issue the decision rejecting the opposition as inadmissible (when the formalities officer has already informed the opponent of this deficiency pursuant to D‑IV, 1.3.2); or

(ii)consider the opposition admissible and continue with examination of the opposition (see D‑V); or

(iii)communicate its findings to the opponent(s) in question and at the same time request them to submit observations.

If the opponent does not successfully refute the opinion expressed by the opposition division on the existence of these deficiencies which may no longer be corrected, the opposition division will reject the notice of opposition as inadmissible, possibly after having held oral proceedings. As regards the form of the decision, see E‑X, 2.3 and E‑X, 2.6.

The decision will be communicated to the other parties. An inadmissible opposition or documents produced in support of an inadmissible opposition will be placed in the file and will therefore be available for inspection in accordance with Art. 128(4). As regards the possibility of taking them into consideration as observations by third parties, see D‑V, 2.2 and E‑VI, 3. If there are further admissible oppositions, for reasons of procedural economy this decision to reject the opposition as inadmissible will normally be taken at the end of the procedure together with the decision on the admissible oppositions.

For the possibility of appeal by the opponent and other possible means of redress, see E‑XII, 1 and E‑XII, 7.4. Termination of opposition proceedings in the event of inadmissible opposition

Under Art. 101(1) and Rule 79(1), the examination as to whether the European patent can be maintained can only be performed if at least one admissible opposition has been filed. This means that the opposition division has to refrain from commenting on the substantive merits of the opposition when expressing an opinion on its inadmissibility if there is no further admissible opposition (see T 925/91). Opposition proceedings are terminated if all notices of opposition filed against a European patent have been rejected as inadmissible and the last decision in this respect has become final. This will be communicated to the parties.5. Preparation of substantive examination

5.1 Inadmissibility at a later stage

5.2 Invitation to the patent proprietor to submit comments and communication of opposition to the other parties concerned by the formalities officer

5.3 Filing of amended documents in reply to the notice of opposition

5.4 Communication of observations from one of the parties to the other parties

5.5 Decision concerning the admissibility of an opposition, the patent proprietor being a party

5.6 Examination of the admissibility of an intervention and preparations in the event of an intervention5.1 Inadmissibility at a later stage

The admissibility of the opposition must be examined ex officio in every phase of the proceedings. In particular, the opposition division examines whether the notice of opposition is adequately substantiated (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.1(v)).

Since the admissibility of an opposition is always open to question by the patent proprietor, no separate communication that the opposition is admissible will be sent to the opponent or the patent proprietor. Where deficiencies on the basis of which the notice of opposition is likely to be regarded as inadmissible, but of which the opponent has not been informed by the formalities officer, come to the attention of the opposition division in the opposition documents submitted to it or because the patent proprietor has raised the issue during the proceedings, it will inform the parties about its reservations in a communication and at the same time request the opponent in question to submit observations. If deficiencies within the meaning of Rule 77(2) are involved, it is sufficient to specify a period for the opponent to remedy such deficiencies.

If the opponent does not successfully refute the opinion expressed by the opposition division on the existence of these deficiencies which may no longer be corrected or fails to remedy in good time deficiencies which may be corrected, the opposition division will reject the notice of opposition as inadmissible, possibly after having held oral proceedings. As regards the form of the decision, see E‑X, 2.3 and E‑X, 2.6. For subsequent procedure, see the last two paragraphs of D‑IV, 3.5.2 Invitation to the patent proprietor to submit comments and communication of opposition to the other parties concerned by the formalities officer

If formalities officers consider that no further ex-officio objection to the admissibility of each or the only opposition remains, they will invite the patent proprietor, immediately after expiry of the opposition period or the period laid down by the formalities officer for the remedying of the deficiencies in accordance with Rule 77(2) (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.2), or for the presentation of evidence (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.1(v)), to file observations concerning the oppositions communicated earlier and to file amendments, where appropriate, to the description, claims and drawings within a four-month period. Extension of the time limit will only be granted in exceptional cases on the basis of a duly substantiated request (see E‑VIII, 1.6, and the notice from the EPO dated 31 May 2016, OJ EPO 2016, A42). The above procedure also applies to oppositions where a decision to the effect that they are deemed not to have been filed or are inadmissible has not yet been taken or has not yet become final.

If several notices of opposition have been filed, the formalities officer will communicate them to the other opponent(s) at the same time as the communication provided for in the previous paragraph. This will not be combined with an invitation to file observations or the setting of a time limit.

However, copies of documents supporting the parties' submissions which are available for inspection via in the Register will no longer be transmitted (see A‑XI, 2 and the notice from the EPO dated 28 August 2020, OJ EPO 2020, A106).

Rule 79(1) and Rule 79(2)5.3 Filing of amended documents in reply to the notice of opposition

Amended documents must, provided that it is not irrelevant at the stage reached in the procedure, be as complete as possible and drawn up in such a way as to allow the European patent, where appropriate, to be maintained without further delay in the amended version.

These considerations apply also to auxiliary requests in which the patent proprietor proposes amendments for consideration by the opposition division only if the division is unable to grant the main request, for example that the opposition is to be rejected. In both cases, however, it will be more convenient in certain circumstances to determine first the form of the claims, leaving purely consequential amendments in the description to be dealt with later (see D‑V, 5).

Care must be taken to ensure that any amendments do not offend against Art. 123(2) and Art. 123(3) (see D‑V, 6, H‑IV, 5.3 and H‑V, 2 and H-V, 3). It must also be checked that the patent, by the amendments themselves, does not contravene the requirements of the EPC (with the exception of Art. 82, see D‑V, 2.2). Forthe form of amended documents, see H‑III, 2.2 to 2.4.

Amendments of the description in opposition should be carried out by submitting amended paragraphs replacing specific numbered paragraphs of the B publication of the patent. This allows the opposition division and the opponents to verify the amendments efficiently. For reasons of procedural economy, the filing of a completely retyped description should be avoided (see H‑III, 2.3). See also H‑III, 2.2 to H-III, 2.4 for the form of amended documents.

Proprietors' observations, and any amendments they make, are communicated to the opponent(s) by the formalities officer without delay for information. No time limit for reply is set.5.4 Communication of observations from one of the parties to the other parties

The formalities officer will, at any stage in the procedure, immediately communicate the observations of any of the parties to the other parties for information. However, copies of documents supporting the parties' submissions, which are available for inspection via the Register, will no longer be transmitted (see also D‑IV, 5.2, A‑XI, 2 and the notice from the EPO dated 28 August 2020, OJ EPO 2020, A106).

If the opposition division considers that observations are called for in the course of the further procedure, a separate invitation is issued and a period is fixed (normally four months), with or without a communication stating the grounds.

Rule 79(3) Rule 81(2)5.5 Decision concerning the admissibility of an opposition, the patent proprietor being a party

If the patent proprietor, when replying to the notice of opposition, contends that the opposition is inadmissible pursuant to Rule 77(1) and Rule 77(2) because of deficiencies specified by the patent proprietor himself, the opponent concerned must be given the opportunity to submit comments within a period fixed by the formalities officer (normally two months).

If the opposition division concludes that the opposition is inadmissible, it must as a rule first take a reasoned decision, possibly after having held oral proceedings. This decision is appealable. If, on the other hand, on the basis of another – admissible – opposition against the same patent, a an immediate final decision with regard to all substantive issues can be taken on the rejection of the opposition or oppositions or on the revocation of the patent, the decision on admissibility is to be taken together with this final decision.

If, despite the observations of the patent proprietor, the opposition division concludes that the opposition is admissible, the decision on admissibility is normally to be taken together with the final decision, especially where at least one other admissible opposition exists (see D‑I, 6). If the opposition division is of the opinion that all oppositions are inadmissible, a reasoned decision is to be taken, which is appealable.

An opponent whose opposition has been finally rejected as inadmissible is no longer a party to the subsequent proceedings once this decision becomes final.5.6 Examination of the admissibility of an intervention and preparations in the event of an intervention

When examining whether an intervention is admissible, the formalities officer and the opposition division will proceed as for the examination as to admissibility of an opposition (see D‑IV, 1, D-IV, 3 and D-IV, 5.5) but on the basis of the requirements for intervention under Art. 105 and Rule 89.

Rule 79(4)

Paragraphs D‑IV, 5.2 and D-IV, 5.4, may, however, be disregarded in the case of an intervention in opposition proceedings.

Accordingly, particularly in the case of proceedings which are at an advanced stage, the formalities officer will inform third parties who have intervened of the progress of the proceedings and request them to indicate within one month whether they will also require the documents received from the parties in accordance with Rule 79(1) to Rule 79(3), together with the communications from the opposition division and the observations of the parties under Rule 81(2), for the preceding period. If this is the case, the formalities officer will send them with the relevant communications from the opposition division or the formalities officer to the intervening third party.

Rule 86Chapter V – Substantive examination of opposition

1. Beginning of the examination of the opposition

2. Extent of the examination

3. Non-patentability pursuant to Art. 52 to 57

4. Insufficient disclosure of the invention

5. Clarity of claims and support by the description

6. Subject-matter of the European patent extending beyond the original disclosure1. Beginning of the examination of the opposition

Once the preparations for the examination of the opposition have been completed pursuant to Rule 79, the opposition division examines whether the grounds for opposition (see D‑III, 5) laid down in Art. 100 prejudice the maintenance of the European patent. The examination may also begin if a single admissible opposition has been withdrawn in the interim (see D‑VII, 5.3). If the opponent has died or is legally incapacitated, the examination may begin even without the participation of the heirs or legal representatives (see D‑VII, 5.2).

Art. 101(1)2. Extent of the examination

2.1 Extent to which the patent is opposed

2.2 Examination of the grounds for opposition2.1 Extent to which the patent is opposed

In the unusual case where an opposition is limited to only a certain part of the patent, the opposition division has to limit its examination to the part opposed. In particular, the opposition division cannot decide on the revocation of the patent beyond the extent to which it was opposed in the notice of opposition. However, if the opposition is directed only to an independent claim, the dependent claims are considered to be implicitly covered by the extent of the opposition and may be examined by the opposition division, provided their validity is prima facie in doubt on the basis of the information already available (see G 9/91). Similarly, if only a process claim is opposed, a product-by-process claim making reference to the same process is considered to be implicitly covered by the extent of opposition and may be examined under the same conditions as above (see T 525/96).2.2 Examination of the grounds for opposition

Opposition proceedings are not a continuation of examination proceedings. Hence as a general rule the opposition division will confine its examination to those grounds for opposition brought forward by the opponent. If, for example, the opposition is filed only on the grounds that the subject-matter of the European patent is not sufficiently disclosed or that it extends beyond the content of the patent application as filed, the opposition division will examine the patentability of the subject-matter of the European patent pursuant to Art. 52 to Art. 57 only if facts have come to its notice which, prima facie, wholly or partially prejudice the maintenance of the patent (see G 10/91).

A document indicated in the patent specification as the closest or important prior art for the purposes of elucidating the technical problem set out in the description forms part of the opposition proceedings even if not expressly cited within the opposition period. The same applies to any relevant documents cited in the patent specification which do not constitute the closest prior art but whose contents are nevertheless important for understanding the problem underlying the invention within the meaning of Rule 42(1)(c) EPC (T 536/88, in particular point 2.1).

Once proceedings for examining the opposition(s) have been initiated because an admissible opposition has been filed (although it may have been withdrawn in the interim), there may be reason to believe that other grounds exist which, prima facie, in whole or in part prejudice the maintenance of the European patent. If that is the case, these grounds will generally be examined by the opposition division of its own motion pursuant to Rule 81(1). Such other grounds may result from facts emerging from the search report or the examination procedure, the division'sexaminer's personal knowledge of the division's members or observations presented by third parties pursuant to Art. 115 (see also E‑VI, 3). Such grounds may also have been put forward in another opposition which has been rejected as inadmissible, or in another opposition deemed not to have been filed. They may also be any grounds submitted belatedly (see E‑VI, 1.1 and E‑VI, 2). Under Art. 114(1), such prejudicial grounds put forward in an opposition which has been withdrawn will also generally be examined by the opposition division of its own motion. In carrying out such examination the opposition division will, however, take the interests of procedural expediency into account (see E‑VI, 1.2). If the decision is to be based on grounds to be taken into account pursuant to Art. 114(1) or Rule 81(1), the parties must be given the opportunity to comment (see E‑X, 1).

If during examination of the opposition an allegation about a relevant fact seems plausible, it may be taken into account without further evidence if it is not challenged by the other party.

If a fact is contested or not plausible, the party making the allegation must prove it. If the parties to opposition proceedings make contrary assertions which they cannot substantiate and the opposition division is unable to establish the facts of its own motion, the patent proprietor is given the benefit of the doubt (see T 219/83, Headnote I).

For example, if the opponent raises an objection under Art. 100(b) and provides experimental evidence that e.g. the claimed process cannot be realised, and the patent proprietor replies that the process can be carried out without undue burden by the skilled person taking common general knowledge also into consideration (T 281/86, OJ EPO 1989, 202; reasons 6), the patent proprietor has to provide proof of what was common general knowledge at the filing date (or the date of the earliest priority if priority has been claimed).

Pursuant to Art. 100, the absence of unity of invention is not a ground for opposition (see D‑III, 5).

Rule 81(1) Art. 114

Since unity of invention under Art. 82 is only required for the European patent application, the unity of the subject-matter of the European patent may not be examined by the opposition division, even of its own motion. In particular, where the facts, evidence and arguments which come to light in the opposition proceedings lead to the maintenance of the European patent in amended form, there will be no further examination as to whether the remaining subject-matter of the patent contains a single invention or more than one. Any lack of unity must be accepted (see G 1/91).

Similarly, where amendments occasioned by a ground for opposition (see H‑II, 3.1) contain multiple independent claims in the same category and are still covered by the independent claim as granted, compliance with Rule 43(2) will not be examined further.

The grounds for opposition laid down in Art. 100 are examined in greater detail below.

Art. 823. Non-patentability pursuant to Art. 52 to Art. 57

The same substantive requirements apply in the opposition procedure regarding patentability pursuant to Art. 52 to Art. 57 as in the examination procedure. G‑I to G-VII will therefore also be applied in opposition proceedings. However, it will be more common in opposition proceedings than in examination procedure for the examination as to patentability to be based on the state of the art as made available to the public not by written description but "by means of an oral description, by use, or in any other way" (see Art. 54(2) and G‑IV, 7).

Art. 100(a)4. Insufficient disclosure of the invention

Determination of whether the disclosure of an invention in a European patent application is sufficient is dealt with in F‑III, 1 to F-III, 3.

The principles set out there will also apply mutatis mutandis to the opposition procedure. The overriding consideration in this context is the disclosed content of the European patent specification, that is to say what a person skilled in the art is able to derive directly and unambiguously from the explicit and implicit disclosure in the patent claims, description and drawings, if any, without using inventiveness. Pursuant to Art. 100(b), the patent has to disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by persons skilled in the art. If the patent specification does not disclose the invention sufficiently clearly to enable it to be carried out over the full scope of the claim in accordance with Art. 100(b), this may be remedied, provided the original documents contained a sufficient disclosure, but subject to the condition that, as required under Art. 123(2), the subject-matter of the European patent does not extend beyond the content of the application as filed and, as required under Art. 123(3), the protection conferred is not extended.

The skilled person wishing to implement the claimed invention reads the claims in a technically sensible manner. An objection of insufficient disclosure of the invention is therefore not to be based on embodiments that are meaningless and not consistent with the teaching of the application as a whole (see T 521/12).

There is normally no deficiency under Art. 100(b) if a feature which is essential for performance of the invention is missing from the claim but is disclosed in the description and/or drawings. However, unduly broad claims may be objected to under Art. 56 (see T 939/92).

Art. 100(b)5. Clarity of claims and support by the description

Clarity is not a ground for opposition. Opposition proceedings are not designed as a procedure for generally amending (or revoking) patents that contain any kind of defect, and therefore opposition proceedings are not to be regarded as a continuation of examination proceedings. As a general rule this means that a granted claim has to be lived with even if new facts (e.g. new prior art) demonstrate that the claim is unclear (G 3/14).

Art. 100

In considering whether, for the purpose of Art. 101(3), a patent as amended meets the requirements of the EPC, the claims of the patent may be examined for compliance with the requirements of Art. 84 only when, and then only to the extent that, an amendment introduces non-compliance with Art. 84 (G 3/14, confirming the jurisprudence as exemplified by T 301/87). A lack of compliance with Art. 84 cannot be seen as having been introduced by an amendment if a clarity problem already present in the claims as granted is only brought into notice, highlighted or made visible by the amendment.

According to G 3/14, the amendment of one claim or part of a patent cannot lead to a re-examination of other parts of the patent which have not been amended. Thus, the deletion of an independent claim with its dependent claims or the deletion of a dependent claim leaving the independent claims and other dependent claims intact does not permit examination of the remaining claims for compliance with Art. 84.

A claim amended during opposition proceedings is not subject to examination for compliance with Art. 84 if it results from

(i)inserting a complete dependent claim as granted into an independent claim;

(ii)combining one of several alternative embodiments of the dependent claim as granted with the independent claim as granted;

(iii)deleting wording from a granted claim (whether independent or dependent), whereby its scope is narrowed but a pre-existing lack of compliance with Art. 84 is left intact (as exemplified by T 301/87); or

(iv)deleting optional features from a granted claim (whether independent or dependent).

However, an amended claim is to be examined for compliance with Art. 84:

(v)if features are taken from the description and inserted into a granted claim by way of amendment; or

(vi)if a feature from a dependent claim as granted is introduced into an independent claim as granted and this feature was previously connected with other features of that dependent claim and an alleged lack of compliance with Art. 84 is introduced by the amendment.

Correspondingly, the description of the patent may be examined for compliance with the requirements of Art. 84 only when, and then only to the extent that, an amendment of the patent introduces non-compliance with Art. 84. In particular, inconsistencies between the description and the claims resulting from amendments during opposition proceedings and casting doubt on the subject-matter for which protection is sought must be avoided (see F‑IV, 4.3 for examination of inconsistencies between the description and the claims in general).

Other amendments of the description not resulting from amendments of the claims during opposition proceedings may be allowed under the conditions laid down in H‑II, 3.2.

Art. 101(3)6. Subject-matter of the European patent extending beyond the original disclosure

6.1 Basis of this ground for opposition

6.2 Distinction between allowable and unallowable amendments6.1 Basis of this ground for opposition

This ground for opposition under Art. 100(c) refers back to Art. 123(2) and stipulates that the subject-matter of a European patent may not extend beyond the content of the application as filed. In the case of a patent granted on the basis of a European divisional application (Art. 76(1)), two criteria apply: the subject-matter must not extend beyond the content of the earlier application as filed (Art. 76(1)), and it must not extend beyond the content of the divisional application as filed (Art. 123(2)) (see T 873/94). Similar considerations apply to applications filed under Art. 61. In the case of a patent granted on an application filed in a language other than an official language of the EPO either in accordance with Art. 14(2) or in accordance with Rule 40 (see Rule 40(3)), the original text will, as provided for in Art. 70(2), constitute the basis for determining whether the subject-matter of the European patent extends beyond the content of the application as filed. However, unless, for example, the opponent adduces proof to the contrary the opposition division may, under Rule 7, assume that the translation referred to in Art. 14(2) or Rule 40(3) is in conformity with the original text of the application.

Art. 100(c)6.2 Distinction between allowable and unallowable amendments

The distinction between allowable amendments to the content of a European patent application and amendments which are at variance with Art. 123(2) or Art. 76(1) is set forth in H‑IV, 2, and C‑IX, 1.4. These guidelines will be applied mutatis mutandis in the course of opposition proceedings to determine whether the subject-matter of the European patent as granted or as amended during the opposition proceedings extends beyond the content of the application as filed.Chapter VI – Procedure for the examination of the opposition

(Oral proceedings: see E‑III; taking and conservation of evidence: see E‑IV).

1. General remarks

2. Adherence to the text of the European patent submitted or approved by the patent proprietor

3. Invitation to file observations

4. Communications from the opposition division to the patent proprietor

5. Additional search

6. Examination of the opposition during oral proceedings

7. Preparation of the decision

8. Request to stay opposition proceedings1. General remarks

The opposition division will first of all endeavour to reach a decision in written proceedings. Taking account of the investigations usually conducted beforehand by the first member primary examiner (see D‑II, 5 and D-II, 6), the opposition division will base its decision on the written submissions of the parties and, where appropriate, on other written evidence obtained, in particular, through the production of documents, requests for information and sworn statements in writing.

The parties in inter partes cases are subject to a particular duty to facilitate due and swift conduct of the proceedings, in particular by submitting all relevant facts, evidence, arguments and requests as early and completely as possible (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.1 and E‑IV, 1.2). Furthermore, any ground, fact and evidence filed by the opponent(s) after the expiry of the opposition period are considered as late-filed unless they are due to a change in the subject of the proceedings; see E‑VI, 2 and subsections for more details. Admissibility of amendments by the proprietor is treated in detail in H‑II, 3 to H‑II, 3.5, E‑VI, 2.2.2 and E‑VI, 2.2.3.

Art. 114(2) Rule 76(2)(c) Rule 80

If the opposition division considers it expedient, or if any party requests oral proceedings, oral proceedings in accordance with Art. 116(1) will be held before the opposition division after suitable preparation (see D‑VI, 3.2). In the oral proceedings, the parties may state their cases and make submissions in order to clarify outstanding questions. Members of the opposition division may put questions to the parties.

Art. 116

In special, less common cases it will occasionally prove necessary in opposition proceedings for oral evidence to be taken by the opposition division as part of oral proceedings or for the conservation of evidence, or by the first member primary examiner outside the oral proceedings. The opposition division is not obliged to take oral evidence if it does not consider it necessary, even if a party has so requested. Oral evidence may be taken, where appropriate under oath, before the competent court in the country of residence of the person to be heard. A member of the opposition division may, at the request of the opposition division, attend such court hearings (see E‑IV, 1.3).

The principal means of taking oral evidence will be the hearing of witnesses and parties (see E‑IV, 1.6).

Only in exceptional cases will evidence be obtained at the initiative of the opposition division by means of oral and/or written reports by experts (see E‑IV, 1.8.1) or by carrying out an inspection (see E‑IV, 1.2, last paragraph). In view of the specialised knowledge of the members of the opposition division – and of the costs involved – such means will be used only as a last resort.

Rules 117 to Rule 1202. Adherence to the text of the European patent submitted or approved by the patent proprietor

2.1 Basis for the examination

2.2 Revocation of the patent2.1 Basis for the examination

If the patent proprietors submit amendments to the description, claims or drawings after the notice of opposition has been communicated to them (see H‑II, 3), the opposition division must take as a basis for its examination the text of the European patent submitted by the patent proprietors. This principle, that the opposition division must concern itself solely with the text most recently "submitted or agreed by the patent proprietor", also applies to the rest of the opposition procedure. (As regards the possibility of amending texts, see H‑IV, 3.1, second paragraph).

Art. 113(2)2.2 Revocation of the patent

Where it is stated that the patent proprietor no longer approves the text in which the patent was granted and no amended text is submitted, the patent must be revoked. This also applies when the patent proprietor requests that the patent be revoked.3. Invitation to file observations

3.1 Opposition division's communications

3.2 Summons to oral proceedings3.1 Opposition division's communications

In examining the opposition, the opposition division will invite the parties, as often as is necessary, to clarify the substance of the case, to file observations on communications from another party or issued by itself (see E‑II, 1) and, where appropriate, to adduce evidence in respect of matters under dispute. Rule 81(2) does not require the opposition division to set a period for replying to this invitation. Such a period will, however, be set whenever the opposition division considers this expedient. As regards the length of the period see E‑VIII, 1.2, as regards the extension of a period see E‑VIII, 1.6, and as regards late submission of observations see E‑VIII, 1.7 and E‑VIII, 1.8, as well as Art. 114(2).

Art. 101(1) Rule 81(2)

Communications from the opposition division and all replies thereto must be communicated to all parties.

Rule 81(2)3.2 Summons to oral proceedings

If oral proceedings have to be arranged, the parties must be summoned to them as quickly as possible at reasonable notice (see E‑III, 6). If the first action of the opposition division is to summon the parties, the first substantive communication of the opposition division under Art. 101(1) is annexed to the summons to oral proceedings. For the form of oral proceedings, see E‑III, 5, E‑III, 1.2 and E‑III, 1.3.

Art. 116(1) Rule 115(1)

Together with the summons, the opposition division will draw attention to and in the annexed communication explain the points which in its opinion need to be discussed for the purposes of the decision to be taken; where this has already been done sufficiently in a prior communication, it is appropriate to refer to that communication. Normally, the annexed communication will also contain the provisional and nonbinding opinion of the opposition division on the positions adopted by the parties and in particular on amendments filed by the patent proprietor. At the same time, a date will be fixed up to which written submissions may be made or amendments may be filed. Normally this date will be two months before the date of the oral proceedings. As this date is not a time limit, Rule 132 does not apply and the parties cannot request to postpone it.

The summons to oral proceedings and the annexed communication do not constitute decisions within the meaning of Art. 106(1) and can thus only be appealed together with the final decision (see T 1954/14) unless either of them allows a separate appeal to be filed (see E‑X, 3).

Rule 116(1)4. Communications from the opposition division to the patent proprietor

4.1 Communications from the opposition division; reasoned statement

4.2 Invitation to file amended documents4.1 Communications from the opposition division; reasoned statement

Where necessary, any communication to the patent proprietor must contain a reasoned statement. This also applies to any communication to other parties which is communicated to the proprietor of the patent for information only. A reasoned statement will usually not be required if the communication concerns only matters relating to form or if it contains no more than self-explanatory proposals. Where appropriate, all the grounds against the maintenance of the European patent are to be given in the communication.

Rule 81(3)4.2 Invitation to file amended documents

If the opposition division considers that the European patent cannot be maintained in an unamended form, it must inform the patent proprietors accordingly, stating the grounds, and give them the opportunity to amend, in appropriate cases, the description, claims and drawings. As regards the time limit here, see E‑VIII, 1.2. Where necessary, the description adjusted in line with the new claims (see D‑IV, 5.3 and D‑V, 5) will also deal with the state of the art as set out in the opposition proceedings, the technical purpose and the advantages of the invention as it will then stand. However, if the patent proprietor has neither requested oral proceedings nor filed amendments (including any auxiliary requests), the patent can be revoked directly on the basis of the grounds, evidence and arguments on file (see also E‑X, 1.1).

Proposals for amendment filed at a late stage in the proceedings may be disregarded (see T 406/86).

For amended documents, see H‑III, 2.

Rule 81(2) and Rule 81(3)5. Additional search

In exceptional cases, the opposition division, like the examining division, may on its own initiative cite new material relating to the state of the art and take it into account in its subsequent decision (see C‑IV, 7.4). In the normal course of events, however, since the grant of the patent will have been preceded by a search into the subject-matter of the application by the search division, by the examining division and generally by the opponent(s), no additional search will be made. Only in exceptional cases will an additional search by the opposition division be set in train. Such a case might arise, for example, if in the opposition the main subject covered by the patent shifts to elements of a dependent claim which were originally of subsidiary importance, to elements which were previously not set out in the claims, but only in the description, to individual features of a combination, or to sub-combinations, and there are grounds for believing that the original search did not extend to such elements or features and if no relevant document can be found quickly in the circumstances set out in C‑IV, 7.4.6. Examination of the opposition during oral proceedings

For details regarding the examination shortly before and during oral proceedings and the conduct thereof, see E‑III, 8.7. Preparation of the decision

7.1 General remarks

7.2 Preparation of a decision to maintain a European patent in amended form7.1 General remarks

If the opposition division does not consider it expedient to arrange for oral proceedings of its own motion (see E‑III, 4 and below) or for the taking of evidence even where the latter is requested (see E‑IV), and if no admissible request for oral proceedings has been received from a party (see E‑III, 2), the decision must be reached on the basis of written proceedings. In this case there is no obligation to arrange for oral proceedings before a decision is reached.

If the case is decided on the basis of written proceedings, submissions filed after the decision has been handed over to the EPO internal postal service for remittal to the parties can no longer be considered, as from that moment the division cannot amend the decision (see G 12/91), except to the limited extent provided for in Rule 140 (see H‑VI, 3.1).

The decision, whether or not preceded by oral proceedings or the taking of evidence, may be to revoke the patent (see D‑VIII, 1.2), to reject the opposition (see D‑VIII, 1.3) or to maintain the patent as amended (see D‑VIII, 1.4).

Art. 116(1) Rule 1177.2 Preparation of a decision to maintain a European patent in amended form

7.2.1 Procedural requirements

7.2.2 Decision on the documents on the basis of which the patent is to be maintained

7.2.3 Request for publishing fee, translations and a formally compliant version of amended text passages7.2.1 Procedural requirements

A decision to maintain the patent in amended form may be delivered only when the patent proprietor has approved the new text on the basis of which the opposition division intends to maintain the patent and the opponent has had sufficient opportunity to comment on the proposed new text.

Both prerequisites can be fulfilled during oral proceedings at which the opposition division establishes the text including the amended description and, if necessary, the amended figures. In written proceedings, the necessary opportunity to comment on the new text on the basis of which the opposition division intends to maintain the patent is given to the opponent when a communication is issued to the parties. Once these requirements have been met, a separate communication under Rule 82(1) is neither necessary nor appropriate (see G 1/88).

If the patent can be maintained in the amended form, the opposition division tries to obtain the patent proprietor's approval of the text in which the patent can be maintained and gives the opponent an opportunity to comment on it. An interlocutory decision can then be delivered.

If these requirements have still not been met and no oral proceedings are being held, a communication under Art. 101(1) must be issued. This also applies when it has been established in principle that the patent can be maintained in a particular form but a complete text expressly approved by the patent proprietor is not yet available.

The patent proprietor's approval of an amended version of the patent need not be given in a separate, express declaration; it may also be apparent from the circumstances, in particular from the fact that an amended version was filed or requested. This applies equally to versions which have been filed as an auxiliary request. (For the wording of documents in oral proceedings, see E‑III, 8.11 and E‑III, 8.11.1).

Art. 113

The patent proprietor's approval can also be obtained through a communication under Rule 82(1) in which the opposition division informs the parties that it "intends to maintain the patent as amended" and invites them to "state their observations within a period of two months if they disapprove of the text in which it is intended to maintain the patent". If no objections are filed to the text thus notified, the patent proprietor is considered to approve of it.

A communication under Rule 82(1) can also be sent if the opposition division considers that the complete document expressly approved by the patent proprietor, on which the opponent has been able to comment, still requires amendments. However, these must not go beyond such editorial changes to the wording as appear absolutely necessary by comparison with the text most recently submitted or approved by the patent proprietor. The opposition division will draw attention to such amendments and state why they are required if they are not self-explanatory.

If within the period specified in the communication, or in a communication under Rule 82(1), the patent proprietor objects to the text in which the patent is to be maintained, the proceedings are continued. The European patent can be revoked in the subsequent proceedings if the patent proprietor objects to the text and fails to submit new, properly amended documents despite having been requested to do so.

If any opponent objects to the text communicated to them in which it is intended to maintain the patent, the opposition division will continue examining the opposition if it considers that the EPC prejudices the maintenance of the patent in the text initially envisaged.

Rule 82(1)7.2.2 Decision on the documents on the basis of which the patent is to be maintained

If the opposition division considers that the patent can be maintained on the basis of the text submitted or approved by the patent proprietor, and the opponent has had sufficient opportunity to comment on this text – either in writing or during oral proceedings – as well as on the reasons decisive to the patent's maintenance, the opposition division will issue an interlocutory decision to the effect that the patent and the invention to which it relates meet the requirements of the EPC following the amendments made by the patent proprietor during the opposition proceedings.

If the patent can only be maintained on the basis of an auxiliary request, the decision has to contain a reasoned statement why the version of the main request (and any higher-ranking auxiliary request) does not meet the requirements of the EPC (see E‑X, 2.9, H‑III, 3.4.1 and H‑III, 3.4.2 T 234/86).

A separate appeal under Art. 106(2) is allowed against this decision, which must be reasoned having regard to the grounds for opposition maintained by the opponent or taken up by the opposition division. The decision is delivered in all cases where a European patent is maintained in amended form, even if the opponent has approved of the text communicated by the opposition division or has not commented on it. In the former case, the decision is fairly brief, merely noting that in the light of the amended text the opponent no longer maintains the original grounds for opposition. If this decision is not contested, the ruling enshrined in it becomes final and as a result the documents can no longer be amended.

This interlocutory decision is intended to save the patent proprietor unnecessary translation costs arising from an amendment to the text in appeal proceedings. It nevertheless qualifies as a grant decision in the sense of G 1/10 and corrections can only be requested in the narrow ambit provided for in Rule 140 (see H‑VI, 3.1).7.2.3 Request for publishing fee, translations and a formally compliant version of amended text passages

Once the interlocutory decision becomes final or the amended text in which the patent is to be maintained has been drawn up in opposition appeal proceedings, the formalities officer requests the patent proprietor

– to pay, within three months, the fee for publishing a new specification of the European patent;

– to file translations of any amended claims in the two official languages of the EPO other than the language of the proceedings; and

– to file a formally compliant verbatim version of amended text passages if in oral opposition proceedings the interlocutory decision of the opposition division under Art. 101(3)(a) and Article 106(2) or the board of appeal decision under Art. 111(2) has been based on documents not complying with Rule 50(1) (see E‑III, 8.7).

If the European patent in the amended form contains different claims for different contracting states, a translation of all sets of claims – in the text communicated to the patent proprietor – into all official languages other than the language of the proceedings must be filed.

Rule 82(2)

If the request under the first paragraph above is not complied with "in due time", the acts may still be validly performed within two months of notification of a communication pointing out the failure to observe the time limit, provided that within this two-month period the prescribed surcharge is paid. If any of the acts is not performed within the period of grace, the formalities officer will issue a decision for revocation of the patent in accordance with Rule 82(3).

Rule 82(2) and Rule 82(3) Art. 2(1), item 9, RFees8. Request to stay adjourn opposition proceedings

If a party requests a stay adjournment of opposition proceedings for the sole reason of pending appeal or opposition proceedings of a patent family member (e.g. a parent application), the request will not be granted. The party will receive a communication from the opposition division indicating the reasons for its intention not to grant the request. This communication does not constitute an appealable decision under Art. 106(1) or Art. 106(2).

If oral proceedings take place and the request is maintained, the opposition division will address it at oral proceedings, giving the parties an opportunity to comment. After the oral discussion on the stay adjournment, the opposition division will take a decision on the request.

Reasons for a stay or interruption of proceedings are set out in E‑VII, 1 to E-VII, 3.Chapter VII – Details and special features of the proceedings

1. Sequence of proceedings

2. Request for documents

3. Unity of the European patent

4. Procedure where the patent proprietor is not entitled

5. Continuation of the opposition proceedings in the cases covered by Rule 84

6. Intervention of the assumed infringer

7. Publication of a new specification of the patent

8. Transitional provisions for Art. 54(4) EPC 1973 and Art. 54(5)1. Sequence of proceedings

1.1 Basic principle

1.2 Exceptions1.1 Basic principle

Examination of the admissibility of the opposition and preparation of the examination of the opposition will be commenced immediately after the notice of opposition has been received by the formalities officer or the opposition division (see D‑IV, 1 and D-IV, 3 and D‑V, 1 and D-V, 2).

If during the rest of the proceedings the opposition division, on account of the amount of work in hand, is unable to process immediately all the oppositions submitted, the reference date for the sequence of tasks will, in principle, be the date on which the last observations in respect of which a time limit had been laid down were submitted by any of the parties, but may not be later than the date on which the time limit expired. Documents received unsolicited or not subject to a previously stipulated official time limit, in connection with official communications setting a time limit, will not affect the sequence of tasks unless they require a further early notification setting a time limit.1.2 Exceptions

Notwithstanding D‑VII, 1.1 above, oppositions are to be given priority:

(i)if the earlier examination proceedings were of considerably longer duration than usual;

(ii)if the opposition proceedings have already extended over a considerably longer period than usual;

(iii)if a party to the proceedings has submitted a reasoned request for accelerated processing in a case where an infringement action in respect of the European patent is pending before the Unified Patent Court or a national court of a contracting state, or if the EPO is informed by the Unified Patent Court, a national court or competent authority of a contracting state that infringement actions are pending (see the notice from the EPO from the EPO dated 24 April 2023, Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2023, 9; see E‑VIII, 5 17 March 2008, OJ EPO 2008, 221);

(iv)if other matters to be dealt with, e.g. divisional applications, hinge upon the final decision concerning the opposition; or

(v)if the next procedural step can be dealt with relatively quickly.2. Request for documents

Documents referred to by a party to opposition proceedings must be filed together with the notice of opposition or the written submissions. A single copy of these documents is sufficient. If such documents are neither enclosed nor filed in due time upon invitation by the formalities officer, the opposition division may decide not to take any arguments based on them into account.

In implementing this provision, the desired aim of speeding up the procedure will be borne in mind as much as the common interest in taking obviously relevant submissions into account.

Rule 83

If during the opposition proceedings it becomes apparent that the previous application from which the opposed patent claims priority is not in an official language of the European Patent Office and the validity of the priority claim is relevant to the determination of the patentability of the subject-matter of the patent concerned, the opposition division will invite the patent proprietor to file a translation of that application into one of the official languages within a period to be specified. Alternatively, a declaration may be submitted that the European patent application on the basis of which the opposed patent was granted is a complete translation of the previous application. For the procedure for inviting the patent proprietor to file such a translation or declaration see A‑III, 6.8, and F‑VI, 3.4. Such an invitation is not to be issued if the translation of the previous application or the declaration was available to the European Patent Office and is to be included in the file of the European patent application under Rule 53(2).

Failure by the patent proprietor to supply a required translation or declaration in due time will lead to the priority right being lost. This will have the effect that the intermediate document(s) will become prior art under Art. 54(2) or Art. 54(3), as applicable, and therefore relevant for the assessment of patentability (see A‑III, 6.8.3). The patent proprietor will be notified of this loss of rights (see A‑III, 6.11). As a means of redress, the patent proprietor may request either re-establishment of rights under Art. 122 and Rule 136 (see E‑VIII, 3) or a decision under Rule 112(2) (see E‑VIII, 1.9.3).

Rule 53(3)3. Unity of the European patent

3.1 Basic principle

3.2 Factors affecting the unity of the European patent3.1 Basic principle

If the patent proprietors are not the same for different designated contracting states, the unity of the European patent in opposition proceedings will not be affected, since such persons are to be regarded as joint proprietors (see D‑I, 6, second and third paragraphs).

In particular, the text of the European patent will be uniform for all designated contracting states unless otherwise provided for in the EPC (see D‑VII, 3.2 and H‑III, 4).

Art. 1183.2 Factors affecting the unity of the European patent

The unity of the European patent in opposition proceedings will be affected if the previous patent proprietor and the person replacing them pursuant to Art. 99(4) in respect of a particular contracting state are not deemed to be joint patent proprietors (see D‑I, 6). In this event, the opposition proceedings involving the different patent proprietors must be conducted separately. Since different requests may be submitted by the two patent proprietors (e.g. as regards amendments to the claims), the two sets of opposition proceedings may lead to different conclusions, e.g. as regards the text of the European patent or the scope of protection.4. Procedure where the patent proprietor is not entitled

4.1 Stay of proceedings

4.2 Continuation of proceedings

4.3 Interruption of time limits

4.4 Department responsible4.1 Stay of proceedings

If third parties provide proof, e.g. a certificate from the court concerned, to the EPO during opposition proceedings or during the opposition period that they have opened proceedings against the patent proprietor for the purpose of obtaining a decision within the meaning of Art. 61(1), opposition proceedings are stayed by the Legal Division in accordance with Rule 14(1) EPC unless the third parties consent to their continuation. Such consent must be communicated in writing to the EPO and is irrevocable. However, the proceedings will be stayed only if the opposition division has deemed the opposition admissible.

If proceedings within the meaning of Art. 61(1) are instituted during the opposition period, a stay of proceedings will be possible only if a notice of opposition has been filed. Accordingly, the third party might have to file an opposition itself in order to benefit from a stay of proceedings under Rule 78.

The dates of stay and resumption of proceedings will be entered in the European Patent Register. The parties to the opposition proceedings are to be informed of the order staying the proceedings.

Rule 78(1)

4.1.1 Date of the stay of proceedings

4.1.2 Legal character and effect of the stay of proceedings4.1.1 Date of the stay of proceedings

The proceedings are stayed on the date on which the EPO receives evidence that proceedings against the patent proprietor have been instituted. The requirements for valid institution of relevant proceedings are determined by national law (J 7/00).4.1.2 Legal character and effect of the stay of proceedings

Stay of proceedings is a preliminary procedural measure sui generis which takes immediate effect as a preventive measure to preserve the third party's possible rights (J 28/94; J 15/06).

The patent proprietor will not be heard but may file a request for an appealable decision on the stay of proceedings.

Stay of proceedings means that the legal status quo existing at the time of ordering is maintained, i.e. neither the EPO nor the parties may validly perform any legal acts (J 38/92).

An automatic debit order ceases to be effective on the day on which a stay of the proceedings takes effect (see Point 11.1(c) AAD, Annex A.1 to the ADA, Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2022, page 35). If the automatic debiting procedure is to be used again after resumption of the proceedings, a new automatic debit order is to be filed.4.2 Continuation of proceedings

The date of the continuation of the proceedings and the legal basis for their continuation are to be communicated to the parties to the opposition proceedings.

4.2.1 Continuation after a final decision

4.2.2 Continuation regardless of the stage reached in national proceedings4.2.1 Continuation after a final decision

Proceedings are resumed when evidence is provided that a final decision within the meaning of Art. 61(1) has been taken. If the decision is in favour of the third party, the proceedings may not be resumed earlier than three months after the decision has become final, unless the third-party requests resumption.

Rule 14(2) Rule 78(1)4.2.2 Continuation regardless of the stage reached in national proceedings

When giving a decision on the stay of proceedings or thereafter, the Legal Division may set a date on which it intends to continue the proceedings, regardless of the stage reached in the national proceedings.

Unlike the decision on staying the proceedings, it is at the discretion of the Legal Division to decide whether proceedings are to be resumed. In exercising this discretion, the Legal Division has to take into account the impact of a further suspension or the continuation of the proceedings on each of the parties (J 33/03). Some aspects to be taken into account when exercising this discretion are the duration of the stay and the outcome of first instance proceedings before national courts. Likewise, it will be considered whether delaying tactics are being employed by the third party.

Rule 14(3) Rule 78(1)4.3 Interruption of time limits

The time limits in force at the date of stay are interrupted by the stay of proceedings. The time which has not yet elapsed begins to run as from the date on which proceedings are resumed; however, the time still to run after the resumption of the proceedings must not be less than two months.

Example:

A communication under Rule 82(2) maintaining the patent in amended form is despatched by the EPO on 7 November 2023 24.01.2018. Under Rule 126(2) and Rule 131(2), this communication is deemed delivered on 03.02.2018 the date it bears, i.e. on 7 November 2023 (OJ EPO 2023, A29). The three-month period to pay the publication fee and file the translation of any amended claim starts on the day following delivery of the communication, i.e. on 8 November 2023 04.02.2018, and it ends on 7 February 2024 03.05.2018. Attention is drawn to amended Rules 126, 127 and 131 entering into force on 1 November 2023 and under which computation of periods will change. Detailed information on the changes in practice will be published in the Official Journal of the EPO well in advance.

If proceedings are stayed under Rule 78(1) Rule 14(1) by the Legal Division on 30 November 2023 23.02.2018, the three-month period has elapsed from 8 November 2023 04.02.2018 to 29 November 2023 22.02.2018 before the event of the staying of the proceedings, i.e. 22 days 19 days have already passed and the period remaining is eight days 9 days and 2 two months. Since the remaining period is longer than two months, under Rule 78(1) and Rule 14(4) it will run after the resumption of the proceedings.

Hence, if the proceedings are resumed by the Legal Division on 23 February 2024 07.06.2018, the period for paying the publication fee and filing the translation of the claims runs until 2 May 2024 16.08.2018 for the following reasons:

(i)the day of resumption of the proceedings by the Legal Division (23 February 202407.06.2018) is the first day on which the remaining period starts running again (Rule 131(2) does not apply).

(ii)The remaining days are added first and then the remaining months: in the example, eight days 9 days from and including 23 February 2024 07.06.2018 results in 1 March 2024 15.06.2018, and the addition of another 2 two months results in the remaining period expiring on 1 May 2024 15.08.2018.

(iii)Since Rule 134(1) applies also to the remaining period and since on the 1 May 2024 15.08.2018 no mail is delivered in Munich and Berlin (public holiday), the time limit is extended until 2 May 2024 16.08.2018.

Rule 14(4) Rule 78(1)4.4 Department responsible

The Legal Division is responsible for the procedure where the patent proprietor is not entitled (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 21 November 2013, OJ EPO 2013, 600).

Art. 205. Continuation of the opposition proceedings in the cases covered by Rule 84

5.1 Continuation in the case of surrender or lapse of the patent

5.2 Continuation on the death or legal incapacity of the opponent

5.3 Continuation after the opposition has been withdrawn5.1 Continuation in the case of surrender or lapse of the patent

If the European patent has been surrendered or has lapsed for all the designated states, the opposition proceedings must be continued at the request of the opponent filed within two months after the date on which the opposition division informed the opponent of the surrender or lapse. Evidence of the lapse must generally be provided by submitting extracts from the Patent Registers of the designated contracting states.

Surrender or lapse has immediate nonretroactive effect (i.e. patent protection ceases on the date of surrender or lapse), whereas a revoked patent is deemed to have had no effect from the outset (Art. 68 EPC). So the opponent may still have an interest in the revocation of a lapsed or surrendered patent.

If, in the case of a request for continuation of the proceedings, the patent proprietor has renounced before the competent authorities in the designated states all rights conferred by the patent with ab initio and universal effect, or if no request for continuation has been received within the time limit, the opposition proceedings will be closed. The decision to close the proceedings will be communicated to the parties.

A statement by the patent proprietors making it unambiguously clear that they no longer wish their patent to be maintained is considered to be a request for its revocation, irrespective of the wording used (T 237/86). For details of the procedure to be followed, see D‑VIII, 1.2.5.

Rule 84(1)5.2 Continuation on the death or legal incapacity of the opponent

In the event of the death or legal incapacity of an opponent, the opposition proceedings may be continued by the opposition division of its own motion, even without the participation of the heirs or legal representatives, for example if the legal proceedings in connection with the will or the appointment of a new legal representative would inordinately prolong the opposition proceedings. This provision will apply not only where only one opposition has been filed: it will also apply in cases where not all those who have filed opposition are deceased or legally incapacitated.

The opposition division will continue the proceedings if, for instance, the patent proprietor has submitted amendments to the patent in response to the notice of opposition (see T 560/90). The opposition division will also continue the proceedings if it considers that the stage reached in the opposition proceedings is such that they are likely to result in a limitation or revocation of the European patent without further assistance from the opponent(s) concerned and without the opposition division itself having to undertake extensive investigations (see T 197/88).

The patent proprietor and any other parties are to be informed that the proceedings will be continued. Otherwise the proceedings are closed and the decision to close the proceedings is communicated to the parties.

Rule 84(2)5.3 Continuation after the opposition has been withdrawn

The opposition proceedings can be continued even if every opposition has been withdrawn. The principles set forth in D‑VII, 5.2 apply mutatis mutandis in deciding whether the proceedings are to be continued or closed.

Rule 84(2)6. Intervention of the assumed infringer

Assumed infringers of a patent (see D‑I, 5) may file notice of intervention in the opposition proceedings within three months of the date on which infringement proceedings were instituted against them or on which they instituted proceedings for a court ruling that they are not infringing the patent. Notice of intervention must be filed in a written reasoned statement. It is not deemed to have been filed until the opposition fee has been paid in the amount prescribed in the Rules relating to Fees under the EPC.

Intervention is permissible as long as opposition or appeal proceedings are pending. A third party can become a party to the proceedings during the period for filing an appeal only if a party to the proceedings in which the decision was given files an appeal pursuant to Art. 107; otherwise the decision of the opposition division will become final on expiry of the appeal period (see G 4/91 and G 1/94).

A properly filed and admissible intervention is treated as an opposition, which may be based on any ground for opposition under Art. 100 (see G 1/94). This means that, when intervening at any stage of first-instance proceedings, the intervener enjoys essentially the same rights as any other party to the proceedings. If the intervener introduces new facts and evidence which appear to be crucial, the proceedings may need to be prolonged to enable them to be adequately considered. In all other cases the opposition division must ensure that the intervention does not delay the proceedings.

Art. 105 Rule 89

If the notice of intervention is filed at a late stage of the proceedings, for example when oral proceedings have already been scheduled, the opposition division may dispense with issuing communications under Rule 79(1) to Rule 79(3). The introduction of a new ground for opposition at such a late stage may lead to a postponement of the date set for oral proceedings.

For accelerated processing of oppositions and accelerated processing before the boards of appeal on request, see E‑VIII, 5 and E‑VIII, 6.

Rule 79(4)

The notice of intervention, filed in a written reasoned statement, must contain:

Rule 89(2)

(i)a statement of the grounds for intervention and corresponding evidence. The proceedings providing the grounds for intervention must be directed towards establishing an infringement (or its absence) as a final legal result. Proceedings directed at the preservation of evidence to enable a party to initiate separate infringement proceedings are not sufficient in this regard (see T 439/17).

Art. 105(1)

(ii)the name, address and nationality of the assumed infringer and the state in which the assumed infringer's residence or principal place of business is located. Names of natural persons must be indicated by the person's family name and given name(s), the family name being indicated before the given name(s). Names of legal entities, as well as companies considered to be legal entities by reason of the legislation to which they are subject, must be indicated by their official designations. Addresses must be indicated in such a way as to satisfy the customary requirements for prompt postal delivery at the indicated address. They must comprise all the relevant administrative units, including the house number, if any. Assumed infringers (whether natural or legal persons) whose residence or principal place of business is in an EPC contracting state and who act without a professional representative can use an address for correspondence other than their residence. The address for correspondence must be the assumed infringer's own address. Post cannot be sent to a different (natural or legal) person, since that requires a valid form of representation under Art. 133 and Art. 134. It is recommended that the telephone number and fax number be indicated (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.2(i) and D-IV, 1.4.2);

Rule 76(2)(a) Rule 41(2)(c)

(iii)the number of the European patent at issue in the opposition proceedings in which intervention is made, the name of the patent proprietor and the title of the invention (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.2(ii) and D-IV, 1.4.2);

Rule 76(2)(b)

(iv)a statement of the extent to which the European patent at issue is opposed by way of intervention and of the grounds on which the opposition by way of intervention is based, as well as an indication of the facts and evidence presented in support of these grounds, together with a statement of reasons, i.e. arguments (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.1(iii) to D-IV, 1.2.2.1(v) and D-IV, 1.4.2);

Rule 76(1) Rule 76(2)(c)

(v)if the assumed infringer has appointed a representative, the representative's name and address of place of business in accordance with subparagraph (ii) as set out above (see D‑IV, 1.2.2.2(iii) and D-IV, 1.4.2).

Rule 76(2)(d)

D‑IV, 1 sets out further details and explains how to deal with the intervention if one of these requirements is not fulfilled.

Rule 77(1)7. Publication of a new specification of the patent

If a European patent is maintained in an amended form, the EPO must, as soon as possible after it publishes the mention of the opposition decision, publish a new specification of the European patent containing the description, the claims and any drawings, in the amended form.

Art. 103

Rule 74 applies mutatis mutandis to the new specification of the European patent.

Rule 878. Transitional provisions for Art. 54(4) EPC 1973 and Art. 54(5)

Art. 54(4) EPC 1973 and Rule 23a EPC 1973 continue to apply to patents granted in respect of patent applications filed before 13 December 2007. Consequently, in such cases, the designated countries need to be taken into consideration when assessing the novelty of documents according to Art. 54(3) (see H‑III, 4.2).

Art. 54(5) applies only to patents for which the date of the decision to grant the patent under consideration was taken on or after 13 December 2007 (Special edition No. 1, OJ EPO 2007, 197). If the decision to grant was taken before that date (the date of entry into force of EPC 2000), only "Swiss type" claims are allowed for any second or further medical use (provided these claims meet with all the other requirements of the Convention).

Where the subject-matter of a claim is rendered novel only by a new therapeutic use of a medicament, that claim may no longer take the form of Swiss-type claim for European or international patent applications having a filing date or earliest priority date of 29 January 2011 or later (see G 2/08, OJ EPO 2010, 514 and G‑VI, 6.1 G‑VI, 7.1).

Examples:

Date of entry into force of EPC 2000: 13.12.2007.

The decision to grant for patent EP1 mentions the date of 13.12.2007 in the top box and the date of 07.12.2007 in the bottom line.

EP1 has three claims.

Claim 1: Product X.

Claim 2: Product X for use in medicine.

Claim 3: Product X for use in the treatment of asthma.

Notice of opposition is duly filed in 2008 citing prior-art document D1 under Art. 54(2) EPC which reveals product X and its therapeutic use in the treatment of pain and more specifically headache.

The situation is as follows:

According to G 12/91 and J 7/96, published in OJ EPO 1999, 443, the date when the decision to grant the patent was taken is the date the decision to grant was handed over to the EPO postal service, that is 07.12.2007.

This means that, as regards medical use-related claims, EP1 is treated under the system applicable before EPC 2000's entry into force on 13.12.2007. Thus, Art. 54(5) EPC does not apply to EP1.

Therefore, in the opposition proceedings for EP1, claims 1-3 are no longer acceptable. Claims 1 and 2 are not novel and claim 3 is not in the required "Swiss-type" format for a second medical use (G 5/83). The proprietor of patent EP1 would then need to abandon claims 1 and 2 and reformulate claim 3 as: "Use of product X for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of asthma".

It is to be noted that if the date of handing the decision to grant over to the EPO postal service had been 13.12.2007 or later, then Art. 54(5) EPC would have been applicable and in the current example claim 3 of EP1 could have been maintained as granted.

Example of conflicting prior art:

The mention of grant for a patent EP1 filed on 10.12.2007, designating FR, DE, GB, IT and ES and claiming no priority, is published in the Bulletin in May 2012 and nine months later notice of opposition is filed. One of the novelty objections is raised under Art. 54(3) EPC with regard to a European patent application EP2 published on 18.12.2007, having a valid priority date of 16.06.2006 and validly designating FR, DE and GB. Oral proceedings in this case are held during 2013.

The situation is as follows:

EP1 was granted in respect of a patent application filed before the date of EPC 2000's entry into force (i.e. 10.12.2007). Consequently, as regards Art. 54(3) EPC, the provisions in force before that date apply. So in this case, Art. 54(4) and Rule 23a EPC 1973 still apply (in 2013). Therefore, EP2 is relevant for novelty only for the designations FR, DE and GB but not for the designations IT and ES.

Note that if EP1 had in this case been filed on 13.12.2007, Art. 54(4) and Rule 23a EPC 1973 would no longer be applicable when assessing novelty under Art. 54(3) EPC. Consequently, EP2 would be prior art against the novelty of EP1 as a whole, regardless of any common designations.Chapter VIII – Decisions of the opposition division

General remarks on decisions appear in E‑X.

1. Final decisions on an admissible opposition

2. Other decisions1. Final decisions on an admissible opposition

1.1 General remarks

1.2 Revocation of the European patent

1.3 Rejection of the opposition

1.4 Maintenance of the European patent as amended1.1 General remarks

The opposition division has to take a final decision on the opposition, by revoking the European patent or rejecting the opposition or ruling that the European patent is to be maintained as amended. If the only admissible opposition or all the admissible oppositions are withdrawn and the opposition division takes the view that as the case stands there is no reason for the Office to continue the proceedings of its own motion, the proceedings are closed by means of a formal decision (Rule 84(2), second sentence).1.2 Revocation of the European patent

1.2.1 Revocation on substantive grounds

1.2.2 Revocation for failure to pay the prescribed fee for publishing, to file a translation or to file a formally compliant version of amended text passages

1.2.3 Revocation for failure to notify the appointment of a new representative

1.2.4 Revocation in the event of requirements not being met until after expiry of time limits

1.2.5 Revocation of the patent in the event that the patent proprietor no longer wishes the patent to be maintained as granted1.2.1 Revocation on substantive grounds

If the opposition division is of the opinion that at least one ground for opposition as set out in Art. 100 prejudices the maintenance of the European patent, it will revoke the patent under Art. 101(2), first sentence. Analogously, if the opposition division is of the opinion that the patent as amended during the course of the opposition proceedings does not meet the requirements of the Convention, it will revoke the patent under Art. 101(3)(b).

For revocation because the patent proprietor has not agreed to the text, see D‑VI, 2.2 and D‑VIII, 1.2.5.

Art. 101(2) Art. 101(3)(b)1.2.2 Revocation for failure to pay the prescribed fee for publishing, to file a translation or to file a formally compliant version of amended text passages

Under Rule 82(2) in conjunction with Rule 82(3), if the patent proprietor fails in due time to:

(i)pay the prescribed fee for the printing of a new specification of the European patent,

(ii)file a translation of the amended claims in the two official languages of the EPO other than the language of the proceedings (see D‑VI, 7.2.3), or

(iii)file a formally compliant verbatim version of the amended text passages (see E‑III, 8.7.3),

the European patent will be revoked.

Rule 82(3)1.2.3 Revocation for failure to notify the appointment of a new representative

If opposition proceedings are interrupted according to Rule 142(1)(c) and the patent proprietor, who is not resident in one of the contracting states, does not forward a notification of the appointment of a new representative within the two-month period laid down in Rule 142(3)(a) (see E‑VII, 1.4(i)), the European patent will be revoked.

Rule 142(3)(a)1.2.4 Revocation in the event of requirements not being met until after expiry of time limits

In the cases referred to in D‑VIII, 1.2.2 and D-VIII, 1.2.3, the European patent will be revoked even if the omitted acts have been completed during the period between expiry of the time limit and the taking of a final decision, unless a request for re-establishment of rights has been filed, in which case a decision must first be given on the request.1.2.5 Revocation of the patent in the event that the patent proprietor no longer wishes the patent to be maintained as granted

If patent proprietors state that they no longer approve the text in which the patent was granted and do not submit an amended text, the patent must be revoked pursuant to Art. 101 (see T 203/14 and T 2405/12). This also applies when the patent proprietor requests the patent to be revoked.

If patent proprietors unambiguously declare to the EPO the surrender (or abandonment or renunciation) of the patent, this is interpreted as equivalent to a request that the patent be revoked (see T 237/86). If the request of the patent proprietors is not unambiguous, they are given the opportunity to request that the patent be revoked or to declare that they no longer approve of the patent being maintained as granted. This results in the patent being revoked.1.3 Rejection of the opposition

If the opposition division is of the opinion that the grounds for opposition mentioned in Art. 100 do not prejudice the maintenance of the European patent unamended, it will reject the opposition.

Art. 101(2)1.4 Maintenance of the European patent as amended

1.4.1 Taking of a final decision

1.4.2 Statement in the decision of the amended form of the European patent1.4.1 Taking of a final decision

If the opposition division is of the opinion that, taking into consideration the amendments made by the patent proprietor during the opposition proceedings, the patent and the invention to which it relates meet the requirements of the EPC, it will issue an interlocutory decision to maintain the European patent as amended.

The procedure specified in D‑VI, 7.2.1 to D-VI, 7.2.3 will precede the final decision.

Art. 101(3)(a) Rule 82(1) and Rule 82(2)1.4.2 Statement in the decision of the amended form of the European patent

The decision must state which text of the European patent forms the basis for maintaining it.

1.1 General principle

1.3 Costs to be taken into consideration

1.4 Principle of equity1.1 General principle

Each party to the proceedings must bear the costs it has incurred. However, an opposition division may, for reasons of equity, order a different apportionment of such costs, which may have been incurred during the taking of evidence, in oral proceedings or under other circumstances.

The phrase "taking of evidence" refers generally to the receiving of evidence by an opposition division, whatever the form of such evidence. It includes among other things the production of documents and sworn statements in writing as well as hearing witnesses (see T 117/86).

Art. 104(1) Rule 881.2 Decisions on the apportionment of costs

Apportionment of costs must be dealt with in the decision on the opposition. This apportionment will form part of the main decision and will be incorporated in the operative part of the decision.

The decision will deal only with the obligation on the party or parties concerned to bear costs. The actual amounts to be paid by one party to another must be dealt with in the decision on the fixing of costs (see D‑IX, 2).

A statement that the parties will bear their own costs may be incorporated in the grounds for the decision on the opposition and must be included in cases where one of the parties to the proceedings has submitted a request for a decision on the apportionment of costs which the opposition division does not consider justified.

A decision to apportion costs may be made by the opposition division of its own motion, even if no application for the apportionment of costs has been made.

In the absence of an express decision on the apportionment of costs, each of the parties concerned must bear its own costs.

Rule 88(1)1.3 Costs to be taken into consideration

Apportionment of costs may relate only to those expenses necessary to assure proper protection of the rights involved.

Rule 88(1)

Examples of such expenses are:

(i)expenditure incurred in respect of witnesses and experts, together with other costs arising in connection with the taking of evidence;

(ii)remuneration of the representatives of the parties in respect of oral proceedings or the taking of evidence;

(iii)remuneration of the representatives of the parties in respect of undue delaying of the procedure by one of the parties or in respect of the late filing of documents; and

(iv)expenditure incurred directly by the parties, i.e. their travel expenses in coming to oral proceedings or the taking of evidence.

Costs incurred in respect of superfluous or irrelevant evidence, etc., cannot be apportioned.

In the order of apportionment as part of its decision, the opposition division will state the kind of costs to be differently apportioned and reimbursed to the receiving party as clearly and precisely as possible.

Art. 104(1)1.4 Principle of equity

Reasons of equity will require an opposition division to decide on issuing an order to apportion costs when the costs arise in whole or in part as a result of conduct of one party which is not in keeping with the care required to assure proper protection of the rights involved, in other words when the costs are culpably incurred as a result of irresponsible or even malicious actions. Parties may of course defend their rights or interests (e.g. the proprietors defend their patent) by any legally admissible means within the framework of the opposition proceedings; they may, for example, request oral proceedings or the taking of evidence.

Accordingly, costs incurred as a result of default or of inappropriate legal means used by either party may be charged to the party responsible, even if that party has been successful in the opposition proceedings. Situations resulting from "force majeure" (such as absence at oral proceedings due to a sudden serious illness) do in general not lead to the apportionment of costs.

The following are examples where the principle of equity may be applied:

The costs incurred by the opponent in preparing oral proceedings which have been appointed may be charged to patent proprietors if the latter surrender the patent just before the date appointed for the oral proceedings, although it was clear when the proceedings were being arranged, from a document put forward by the opponent, that the patent proprietors had no case and that they alone were therefore liable for their irresponsible conduct.

If an aspect of the state of the art is adduced as an argument at a late stage and it can be shown, or it is evident, that the party concerned knew of it earlier, e.g. in that the party in question had made prior use of it, the additional costs of further oral proceedings unnecessarily incurred by the other parties may be charged to the party which caused them by submitting this argument at such a late stage.

If relevant facts or evidence are submitted by a party only at a late stage of the proceedings without any good reason and if, as a consequence, unnecessary costs are incurred by another party, the opposition division may decide on the apportionment of costs.2. Procedure for the fixing of costs

2.1 Fixing of costs by the opposition division

2.2 Appeal against the fixing of costs by the opposition division2.1 Fixing of costs by the opposition division

The formalities officer is entrusted with fixing the amount of the costs to be paid to the beneficiary at the request of at least one party. The request from a party to the proceedings to fix the costs is admissible only if the decision in which the apportionment of costs was ordered has become final.

Art. 104(2) Rule 88(2)

A list of costs, with supporting evidence in respect of each amount involved, must be attached to the request. Costs may be fixed once their credibility is established.

Rule 88(2)

The parties will be notified of the costs as fixed by the formalities officer acting for the opposition division.

For an explanation of the duties entrusted to the formalities officers, see D‑II, 7.

Art. 1192.2 Appeal against the fixing of costs by the opposition division

The communication in which the formalities officer has fixed the costs may be reviewed if requested by one of the parties to the proceedings. The opposition division will then issue an appealable decision.

The request for such a decision, stating the reasons on which it is based, must be filed with the EPO in writing within one month after the date of notification of the communication in which the costs have been fixed. This request is not deemed to be filed until the fee for the request of a decision to be issued by the opposition division on the costs as fixed has been paid at the rate prescribed in the Rules relating to Fees under the EPC.

Rule 88(3)

The opposition division will take a decision on the request without oral proceedings.

Rule 88(4)

This final decision by the opposition division can be appealed by each party adversely affected. The appeal will only be admissible if the amount fixed exceeds the appeal fee.

Rule 97(2)3. Enforcement of the fixing of costs

Any final decision of the EPO fixing the amount of costs must be dealt with, for the purpose of enforcement in the contracting states, in the same way as a final decision given by a civil court of the state in the territory of which enforcement is to be carried out. Verification of any such decision must be limited to its authenticity.

"Decision" as referred to above also covers the final fixing of costs by the opposition division.

10. Different sets of claims

11. Multiple requests1. Introduction

The limitation and revocation procedures are centralised ex parte procedures at the level of the EPO which allow the patent proprietor either to have the claims of the granted patent limited or to have the whole patent revoked for all the designated states. More particularly, the limitation procedure offers an opportunity to obtain a limitation of a European patent in a short and straightforward procedure.

Unlike in the opposition procedure, there is no restriction on the period between the grant of the patent and the filing of the request. Accordingly, the request can be filed at any time after grant, after opposition proceedings, or even after expiry of the patent.

The examining division is competent to decide on requests for limitation and revocation. However, certain aspects of this procedure are entrusted to formalities officers (see decisions of the President of the EPO dated 12 December 2013, OJ EPO 2014, A6, and 23 November 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A104).

Rule 912. Examination for deficiencies in the request

2.1 Deficiencies which lead to the request being deemed not to have been filed

2.2 Deficiencies which, if not remedied, lead to the request being rejected as inadmissible2.1 Deficiencies which lead to the request being deemed not to have been filed

On receipt of a request for revocation or limitation of a patent, the formalities officer examiner will examine whether:

(i)the request is filed with the EPO (Art. 105a(1))

(ii)opposition proceedings in respect of the patent are not pending at the time of filing the request (Art. 105a(2) and Rule 93(1))

(iii)the relevant fee is paid (Art. 105a(1) and Art. 2(1), item 10a, RFees)

(iv)where the request is filed in a language according to Art. 14(4), the translation has been filed in due time (Rule 6(2))

(v)where the requester is required by Art. 133(2) to appoint a representative, this was done in due time (Rule 152 (3) and Rule 152 (6)).

If any of these requirements are not met, the request is deemed not to have been filed. This finding is notified to the requester (Art. 119), and the fee is refunded.

Otherwise, the request is considered to have been filed, and the limitation/revocation procedure commences.

Art. 105a2.2 Deficiencies which, if not remedied, lead to the request being rejected as inadmissible

The formalities officer will furthermore examine whether:

(i)the request is filed in writing (Rule 92(1))

(ii)the request includes the particulars of the requester required by Rule 92(2)(a), referring to Rule 41(2)(c)

(iii)the request indicates in which contracting states the requester is the patent proprietor (Rule 92(2)(a))

(iv)the request indicates the number of the patent to be limited or revoked (Rule 92(2)(b))

(v)the request indicates in which contracting states the patent has taken effect, even if in the meantime it has lapsed in one or more of those contracting states (Rule 92(2)(b))

(vi)in cases (iii) and (v), and if the requester is not the patent proprietor for all these contracting states, the requester provides the names and addresses of the other patent proprietors, and evidence of entitlement to act on their behalf (Rule 92(2)(c)); due to the retroactive effect of a limitation/revocation (Art. 68), such evidence is required also in the case where the patent has lapsed in one or more of the contracting states referred to under (v) in the meantime. Note that in the case of joint patent proprietors, whether for the same or different contracting states, the requirements of Rule 151 for appointment of a common representative also apply in the limitation or revocation procedure (see A‑VIII, 1.3)

(vii)where limitation is sought, the request includes the complete version of the amended claims (and of the description and drawings where applicable) (Rule 92(2)(d))

(viii)if the requester has appointed a representative, the particulars according to Rule 41(2)(d) (Rule 92(2)(e)) have been filed.

Rule 92

If any of the above requirements are not met, the requester is invited to correct the deficiencies within a period to be specified.

If the deficiencies are not corrected within this period, the request is to be rejected as inadmissible. This decision is notified to the requester (Art. 119). Re-establishment of rights under Art. 122 is, however, available. The decision rejecting the request is open to appeal (Art. 106(1)).

Otherwise, the request is deemed admissible.

Rule 943. Decision on request for revocation

If the request is for revocation, and is admissible, the examining division will revoke the patent and communicate this to the requester (Art. 105b(2) and Rule 95(1)). The decision takes effect on the date on which it is published in the Bulletin (Art. 105b(3)). In accordance with Art. 68, the effect of the decision is that the patent is revoked ab initio, conferring no rights under Art. 64 or Art. 67. As stated in Art. 105b(3), the decision applies to all contracting states in respect of which the patent was granted. It is not possible for the patent to be revoked only for some contracting states, and not for others.

Art. 105b(2) Rule 954. Substantive examination (limitation)

4.1 Department responsible

4.2 Basis for the examination

4.3 Scope of the examination

4.4 Further stages of the examination

4.5 Third-party observations during the examination4.1 Department responsible

If a request for limitation is deemed to be admissible, then the file will be forwarded to the examining division, as the department responsible for the examination of the request.

Rule 914.2 Basis for the examination

The basis for the examination is the patent as granted or amended in opposition or limitation proceedings (Rule 90). In cases in which there have already been both opposition and limitation procedures, or more than one limitation procedure, the basis for the examination is the patent as amended in the most recent of those procedures.

The requester has the option of providing information (with the request, or later in the procedure) as to why the request is allowable, and/or as to the purpose behind the request, but there is no obligation to do so. The purpose underlying the request is, however, of no relevance to the question whether it is allowable.

Rule 904.3 Scope of the examination

The scope of the examination is limited by Rule 95(2). The examining division is required to decide only whether the amended claims of the request constitute a limitation with respect to the claims as granted or amended (i.e. those referred to in D‑X, 4.2), and whether the amended claims comply with the requirements of Art. 84 and Art. 123(2) and Art. 123(3).

The term "limitation" is to be interpreted as meaning a reduction in the extent of protection conferred by the claims. Mere clarifications or changes made to protect a different subject ("aliud") are not to be considered as limitations.

More particularly, the limitation of a dependent claim only, without any independent claim being limited, is acceptable. However, it is not permissible to introduce non-limiting amendments in the description or in the claims that are not a consequence of the limitation of the claims (for example tidying up unclear claims, making amendments to improve the patent or cosmetic changes). Likewise, adding dependent claims in limitation is not permissible if not directly caused by the limitation introduced in the claims.

Amendments in a claim leading to a scope of protection which is smaller but falls partly outside the extent of protection conferred by the claim previously on file must be dealt with cautiously. Even if the amendment constitutes a limitation, such a claim would generally contravene Art. 123(3) (see also H‑V, 7, for Art. 123(3) in the case of a change of category of a claim).

Rule 95(2)

For interpretation of Art. 84 and Art. 123(2), see F‑IV, 4 and H‑IV, 5.4. The description and drawings are used to interpret the claims in accordance with Art. 69(1) and its Protocol on Interpretation. Amendments made to these parts might therefore introduce matter contrary to Art. 123(3) (see H‑IV, 3.1 and H-IV, 3.3).

Art. 69(1)

For the admissibility of a request for correction under Rule 139 of the documents making up the patent, see H‑VI, 2.1.1.

The filing of auxiliary requests together with a main request is possible (see H‑III, 3).

Rule 1394.4 Further stages of the examination

If the examination under D‑X, 4.3 above leads to the conclusion that the request is allowable, then the next stage of the procedure – the establishment of the formal requirements for limitation as described under D‑X, 5 can begin. Otherwise, in accordance with Rule 95(2), a communication must be sent to the requester identifying the deficiencies and giving the opportunity to correct them within a period to be specified. The normal period is two months (Rule 132(2)). It is, in principle, extendable, but only under exceptional circumstances.

The division may not adapt the description of its own motion (see D‑X, 5). In the case of discrepancy between the claims and the description, an objection will always be raised.

If the requester responds in due time in a manner such that no objections remain, then the procedure continues as in D‑X, 5.

Rule 95(2) provides for only one opportunity to make amendments during limitation. However, if the response to the communication under Rule 95(2) overcomes the objections raised in that communication, but gives rise to new objections, the fundamental principle of the right to be heard under Art. 113(1) will normally make a further communication necessary in order to communicate the new objections to the requester before the decision to reject the request for limitation is issued (see D‑X, 6). Normally, no further amendments may be made in reply to that communication.

Rule 95(2) specifies that the examining division must give the requester one opportunity to correct the deficiencies. However, any request for oral proceedings according to Art. 116 will be granted if the division does not consider the request for limitation to be allowable. No further amendments may be submitted during oral proceedings if the opportunity to make amendments has already been taken.4.5 Third-party observations during the examination

Art. 115 explicitly covers all proceedings before the EPO, not just pre-grant proceedings. Accordingly, its provisions also apply in principle to revocation and limitation proceedings. Patentability under Art. 115 is to be interpreted in a broader sense, so that issues relating to Art. 84 and Art. 123(2) may also be taken into consideration. Requesters could, when responding to an invitation under Rule 95(2), introduce further restrictions intended to address such observations. If they wish to do this, and no invitation under Rule 95(2) is issued, their only option is to file a further request for limitation.

Art. 115 Rule 1145. Formal procedure for limitation when the request is allowable

If the request for limitation is allowable, then according to Rule 95(3) the examining division must communicate this to the requesters and invite them to pay the prescribed fee and file translations of the amended claims into the other two official languages within a period of three months.

The nature of the communication under Rule 95(3) inviting the requester to pay the prescribed fee and file translations of the claims is different from the communication of the intention to grant during examination proceedings under Rule 71(3). During limitation, the text filed by the requester is deemed to be approved, whereas at this stage in examination the text is a version proposed to the applicants and subject to their approval.

Once the communication under Rule 95(3) is received, the requester can only pay the fee and file the translations or have the request rejected for failure to do so. Therefore, the examining division may not, with the communication under Rule 95(3), make amendments of its own motion to the claims of a request for limitation in order to render them allowable or adapt the description of its own motion to the limited claim(s). The provisions of Art. 113 would not be met, since the requester does not have an opportunity to contest or comment on the amendments made.

As in opposition proceedings, the requester benefits from a two-month period of grace for reply with payment of a surcharge (Art. 2(1), item 9, RFees). Reestablishment of rights is available.

Rule 95(3) Art. 2(1), item 8 RFees and item Art. 2(1), item 9, RFees

If the requester pays the fee and files the required translations in due time, the examining division will decide to limit the patent (Art. 105b(2) and Rule 95(3), last sentence). This takes effect on the date on which the mention of the decision is published in the Bulletin.

Art. 105b(2) and Art. 105b(3)

As soon as possible after this, the amended specification will be published by the EPO. The form of publication of the amended patent specification is defined in Rule 96, Rule 73(2) and Rule 73(3) and Rule 74. The procedure for this is the same as in opposition proceedings.

Art. 105c

As for revocation (see D‑X, 3), the effect of the decision to limit the patent is that the patent is limited ab initio.

Art. 686. Rejection of the request

If:

(i)the requester does not respond in due time to the invitation under Rule 95(2) (see D‑X, 4.4 above); or

(ii)the requester responds in due time, but the request is still not allowable; or

(iii)the requester fails to pay the fee(s) and file the translation according to Rule 95(3) (see D‑X, 5 above),

then the examining division will reject the request (Art. 105b(2), last sentence and Rule 95(4)), provided the requirements of Art. 113(1) are met (see D‑X, 4.4).

The decision to reject the request will be notified in accordance with Art. 119 to the requester.

In case (ii), the decision is a reasoned decision taken by the examining division and is subject to appeal.

Rule 111(2) Art. 106(1)7. Relation to opposition proceedings

7.1 Precedence of opposition proceedings

7.2 Filing of opposition after decision on limitation7.1 Precedence of opposition proceedings

The case in which opposition proceedings are already pending when the request for revocation or limitation is filed has been mentioned in D‑X, 2.1. In the opposite case, i.e. where an opposition is filed while revocation or limitation proceedings are pending, the procedure depends on whether the pending proceedings relate to a request for revocation or for limitation.

Rule 93(1)

According to Rule 93(2), if the pending proceedings relate to a request for limitation, the examining division will terminate those proceedings and order the reimbursement of the limitation fee. The limitation procedure is terminated on the day the decision on the limitation procedure is handed over to the internal EPO postal service. If the requester has already paid the fee referred to in Rule 95(3) (see D‑X, 5), this fee will also be refunded. The opposition procedure will then continue in the normal manner.

The decision to terminate the limitation proceedings is notified to the requester (Art. 119).

Rule 93(2) is restricted to limitation proceedings. Therefore, in the case of revocation proceedings, there is no precedence of opposition. Revocation proceedings continue after an opposition is filed, and the case proceeds to opposition only if the request for revocation is deemed not to have been filed, is rejected as inadmissible or is withdrawn. Otherwise, if the patent is revoked, the opponent(s) will be informed of this situation and the opposition proceedings will be terminated.

Rule 93(2)7.2 Filing of opposition after decision on limitation

On rare occasions it may happen that the limitation procedure is finished before an opposition is filed within the nine-month period and the decision to limit has already been published in the European Patent Bulletin. In such cases the opponent does not benefit from a new nine-month period, since the opposition period runs only once from publication of the mention of the grant of the patent. Accordingly, the opponent will not have a full nine-month period to formulate the opposition for the patent as limited.8. Legal status of decisions

The decisions rejecting the request for limitation or revocation as either inadmissible or not allowable (see D‑X, 2 and D-X, 6) are open to appeal, as they are decisions of the examining division terminating a procedure. Accordingly, they are decisions listed as such in Art. 21(3)(a).

Art. 106(1)9. Withdrawal of the request

In the absence of any provision to the contrary and in accordance with normal legal principles, the requester may withdraw the request for limitation or revocation at any time, provided that the request is still pending. In this case, however, the limitation or revocation fee will not be refunded.10. Different sets of claims

Art. 105b(3) specifies that the decision to limit or revoke will apply to the patent in all contracting states for which it has been granted. There is thus a single decision, covering all contracting states, but this decision may include different sets of claims for different contracting states, or determine that the limitation is in other ways different for different contracting states. Such situations could arise in two different sets of circumstances.

Art. 105b(3)

10.1 Limitation results in the claims becoming different in different contracting states

10.2 Limitation is different for different contracting states because the claims as granted were different for different contracting states10.1 Limitation results in the claims becoming different in different contracting states

The limitation could result in the claims becoming different in different contracting states if the requester wishes to restrict the claims with respect to one or more, but not all, contracting states in order to avoid conflict with national prior rights. Such different sets of claims can be allowed, provided that the substantive requirements are met for all sets for which the requester is seeking an amendment.

It follows from Rule 138 that a prerequisite for the introduction of different claims for different contracting states during the limitation procedure is that requesters inform the EPO of the existence of the national prior rights when filing the different sets of claims. If they file different sets of claims without informing the EPO of the national prior rights, then the request is to be refused under Art. 105b(3) and Rule 138.

Rule 138

For applications filed on or after 13.12.2007, different sets of claims can no longer be justified on the basis of prior art under Art. 54(3) (for transitional provisions, however, see D‑VII, 8).

Art. 54(3)10.2 Limitation is different for different contracting states because the claims as granted were different for different contracting states

The limitation is different in different contracting states because the claims forming the basis of the limitation procedure were different in different contracting states. This situation would occur where the patent has different claims for different contracting states, e.g. because of national prior rights or prior art under Art. 54(3) (for patents granted before 13.12.2007 or for patents granted in respect of European patent applications pending at that time), or where under Art. 61 a partial transfer of rights has taken place (Rule 18(2)).

The requester might wish to apply a limitation already introduced for one or more contracting states to the other contracting states, or to bring the claims into line with each other for a different reason. If this results in a single set of claims for all contracting states, and the substantive requirements are met separately for each different set of original claims, then the request would be allowable.

Note that it would also be possible that the circumstances of this paragraph and paragraph D‑X, 10.1 coexist in a single request.11. Multiple requests

Rule 90 defines that the basis for the request can be the claims as amended in limitation proceedings, thus providing for multiple subsequent requests, i.e. a request for limitation or revocation following one or more earlier requests for limitation.

Rule 90Part E Guidelines on General Procedural Matters

ContentsChapter I – Introduction

Part E contains guidelines for those procedural steps in respect of the examination of European patent applications and patents which without major variations may, in so far as the EPC permits, occur at a number of stages in the procedure. Attention is also drawn to Art. 125, which states: "In the absence of procedural provisions in this Convention, the EPO shall take into account the principles of procedural law generally recognised in the Contracting States".Chapter II – Communications and notifications

1. Communications

2. Notification1. Communications

1.1 General remarks

1.2 Number of communications

1.3 Form of decisions, communications and notices1.1 General remarks

Communications are sent, inter alia:

(i)if a party has to be informed of deficiencies, together, where appropriate, with a request to remedy those deficiencies, e.g. in accordance with Rule 55, Rule 58, Rule 59, Rule 62a, Rule 63, Rule 64(1), Rule 71(1), Rule 77(2), Rule 95(2) or Rule 108(2);

(ii)if a party is to be invited to file observations on particular questions or to submit documents, evidence, etc., to clarify the issues involved;

(iii)if, in the opinion of the examining or opposition division, the patent cannot be granted or maintained in the text requested by the applicant or proprietor of the patent, but could possibly be granted or maintained in an amended text of more limited scope;

(iv)if information necessary to the conduct of the proceedings has to be communicated to the parties, e.g. in accordance with Rule 14(2) and Rule 14(3), Rule 35(4) or Rule 142(2) and Rule 142(3);

(v)for preparing oral proceedings, (see E‑III, 5); or

(vi)if a decision is to be based on grounds on which the parties have not yet had an opportunity to comment (see E‑X, 1).1.2 Number of communications

Since each communication issued may entail prolonging the proceedings, the proceedings are conducted in such a way as to manage with as few communications as possible. If a communication has to be issued, it will cover all the points which are necessary, or likely to be of importance, for the particular stage of the proceedings, e.g. the preparation of oral proceedings or of a decision.1.3 Form of decisions, communications and notices

Any decision, communication or notice from the EPO is to be signed by and to state the name of the employee responsible. Where these documents are produced by the employee responsible using a computer, a seal may replace the signature. Where the documents are produced automatically by a computer the employee's name may also be dispensed with. The same applies to pre-printed notices and communications.

Rule 113(1) and Rule 113(2)2. Notification

2.1 General remarks

2.2 Method of notification

2.3 Electronic notification

2.4 Notification by postal services

2.5 Notification to representatives

2.6 Irregularities in the notification2.1 General remarks

The EPO as a matter of course notifies those concerned of decisions and summonses, and of any notice or other communication from which a time limit is reckoned, or of which those concerned must be notified under other provisions of the EPC, or of which notification has been ordered by the President of the EPO; other communications are not subject to formal notification.

Notifications may, where exceptional circumstances so require, be given through the intermediary of the central industrial property offices of the contracting states.

In proceedings before the EPO, any notification to be made must take the form of the original document, or a copy thereof certified by or bearing the seal of the EPO, or a computer print-out bearing such seal, or an electronic document containing such seal or otherwise certified. Copies of documents emanating from the parties themselves do not require such certification.

Art. 119 Rule 125 Rule 126 Rule 1272.2 Method of notification

Notification is to be made by postal services, by delivery on the premises of the EPO, by public notice or, if so agreed by the addressee, by means of electronic communication as determined by the President of the EPO and under the conditions laid down by him governing their use. Further details concerning notifications are given in Rules 126 to Rule 129. Notification through the central industrial property office of a contracting state competent to deal with the addressee must be made in accordance with the provisions applicable to that office in national proceedings.

Rule 125(2) and Rule 125(3)2.3 Electronic notification

Where a user has agreed to receive communications electronically, the electronic document is deemed to be delivered to the addressee on the date it bears unless it has failed to reach its destination.

Even if the addressee can access the electronic document before the date of the document, the decisive date for the purpose of the notification fiction under Rule 127(2) is the date of the document.

In the event of any dispute concerning the delivery of the electronic document, it is incumbent on the EPO to establish that the document has reached its destination and to establish the date on which it did so.

If notification is contested and the EPO establishes that the document reached its destination more than seven days after the date it bears, a period triggered by the deemed receipt of that document will be extended by the number of days by which these seven days were exceeded (see the notice from the EPO dated 6 March 2023, OJ EPO 2023, A29). Rule 134(1) applies only once the period is extended according to the safeguard under Rule 127(2). See E‑II, 2.4 for an example.

Notification may occur in electronic form to an activated Mailbox. Electronic notification comprises the decisions, summonses, notices and communications contained in a list published on the EPO website. The Mailbox may also be accessed through MyEPO Portfolio. For further details, see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 October 2023 concerning the web-based online service MyEPO Portfolio (OJ EPO 2023, A89) and the notice from the EPO dated 9 October 2023, (OJ EPO 2023, A90).

In the event that further means are introduced for electronic notification, the conditions and details will follow from the decisions governing the use of such means.

Rule 127(2)2.4 2.3 Notification by postal services

All notifications by postal services must be by registered letter (see also OJ EPO 2019, A57). The President of the EPO has, so far, not named any other documents to be notified by registered letter with advice of delivery or equivalent.

Under Rule 126(2) as in force until 31 October 2023, the letter is deemed to be delivered to the addressee on the tenth day following its handover to the postal service provider unless the letter has failed to reach the addressee or has reached him at a later date; in the event of any dispute, it is incumbent on the EPO to establish that the letter has reached its destination or to establish the date on which the letter was delivered to the addressee, as the case may be.

Rule 126

With effect from 1 November 2023, Rule 126(2) is amended to read as follows: "Where notification is effected in accordance with paragraph 1, the A notified document shall be is deemed to be delivered to the addressee on the date it bears unless it has failed to reach the addressee. In the case of notification irregularities, the safeguards set out in E‑II, 2.3 apply.

Example:

An examination report under Art. 94(3) bears a date of 30 January 2024 and sets a time limit of four months. The report is delivered on 3 February 2024, which is four days after the date it bears. Thus, there will be no extension under the safeguard and the document will be deemed notified on 30 January 2024. The four-month period triggered by the notification on 30 January 2024 falls on 30 May 2024, on which no mail is delivered in Munich (public holiday). Consequently, the time limit is extended under Rule 134(1) until 31 May 2024.

By contrast, if the document is delivered on 9 February 2024, i.e. ten days after the date it bears, the period will be extended by three days to expire on 2 June 2024 under Rule 126(2). Since 2 June 2024 is a Sunday, the period is further extended under Rule 134(1) to expire on 3 June 2024.

In the event of any dispute concerning the delivery of the document, it shall be incumbent on the EPO to establish that the document has reached its destination and to establish the date on which the document was delivered to the addressee. If the EPO establishes that the document was delivered to the addressee more than seven days after the date it bears, a period for which the deemed receipt of that document is the relevant event under Rule 131, paragraph 2, shall expire later by the number of days by which the seven days were exceeded." (see the decision of the Administrative Council of 13 October 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A101, and the notice from the EPO dated 25 November 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A114).

Notification is deemed to have been effected, even if acceptance of the letter document has been refused.

The law of the state on the territory of which the notification is made applies to other matters concerning notification, e.g. the question whether delivery to a person other than the addressee constitutes an effective notification to the latter.

2.4Electronic notification

Rule 126(2)

Under Rule 127(2) as in force until 31 October 2023, where a user has agreed to receive communications electronically, the electronic document is deemed to be delivered to the addressee on the tenth day after its transmission unless it has failed to reach its destination or has reached it at a later date.

With effect from 1 November 2023, Rule 127(2) is amended to read as follows: "Where notification is effected by means of electronic communication, the electronic document shall be deemed to be delivered to the addressee on the date it bears, unless it has failed to reach its destination. In the event of any dispute concerning the delivery of the electronic document, it shall be incumbent on the EPO to establish that the document has reached its destination and to establish the date on which it reached its destination. If the EPO establishes that the electronic document has reached its destination more than seven days after the date it bears, a period for which the deemed receipt of that document is the relevant event under Rule 131, paragraph 2, shall expire later by the number of days by which the seven days were exceeded." (see the decision of the Administrative Council of 13 October 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A101, and the notice from the EPO dated 25 November 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A114).

Currently, notification may occur in electronic form to an activated Mailbox. Electronic notification comprises the decisions, summonses, notices and communications contained in a list published on the EPO website. For the Mailbox service, the date of transmission is the date indicated on the document, provided that the addressee has access to it in the Mailbox by that date. For further details, see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 11 March 2015 concerning the pilot project to introduce new means of electronic communication in EPO proceedings (OJ EPO 2015, A28) and the notice from the EPO dated 30 March 2015 (OJ EPO 2015, A36).

The Mailbox may also be accessed through MyEPO Portfolio. For further details, see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 11 May 2022 concerning the web-based online service MyEPO Portfolio (OJ EPO 2022, A51) and the notice from the EPO dated 11 May 2022, (OJ EPO 2022, A52).

In the event that further means are introduced for electronic notification, the conditions and details will follow from the decisions governing the use of such means.

Rule 1272.5 Notification to representatives

If a representative has been appointed, notifications must be addressed to him. If several such representatives have been appointed for a single interested party, notification to any one of them is sufficient. If several persons are joint applicants for or proprietors of a patent or have acted in common in filing notice of opposition or intervention and have not appointed a common representative, notification of one person, viz. the person referred to in Rule 151, will again be sufficient. If several interested parties have a common representative, notification of a single document to the common representative is sufficient.

Rule 1302.6 Irregularities in the notification

Where a document has reached the addressee, if the EPO is unable to prove that it has been duly notified, or if provisions relating to its notification have not been observed, the document is deemed to have been notified on the date established by the EPO as the date of receipt. In cases where the EPO is not able to prove the actual date of notification, a letter, for instance, sent by the addressees themselves and indicating the date of receipt, is accepted as proof. If it is evident from a reply from the addressees that they have received the document, although they do not mention the date of its notification, the date on which that reply was written is to be regarded as the date of notification.

1.1 Introduction

1.2 Format of oral proceedings

1.3 Request for oral proceedings to be held on EPO premises

1.4 Request to hold on-site oral proceedings at a particular site1.1 Introduction

By "oral proceedings" is meant formal proceedings within the meaning of Art. 116. The term does not include consultations such as occur in examination proceedings and limitation/revocation proceedings (see C‑VII, 2). In view of Rule 81(2), such consultations are not allowed in opposition proceedings in which more than one party is involved unless the consultations concern matters which do not affect the interests of other parties. An example is proceedings for examining the admissibility of opposition, provided this involves only the EPO and the opponent concerned.

Oral proceedings will take place before the competent body, e.g. within the Receiving Section before the appointed officer and during the examination and opposition procedure before the whole division.

In matters lying within its competence, oral proceedings can be held before the Legal Division. Such proceedings are non-public in both ex parte and inter partes proceedings.

The right to oral proceedings forms a substantial part of the right to be heard under Art. 113.

Art. 18(2) Art. 19(2) Art. 1131.2 Format of oral proceedings

Oral proceedings are held by videoconference. In exceptional circumstances, where there are serious reasons against holding the oral proceedings by videoconference, they may be held on the premises of the EPO, either at the request of a party or at the instigation of the division (OJ EPO 2022, A103, OJ EPO 2022, A106). Examples of serious reasons are, in particular, reasons relating to a participant to the oral proceedings as an individual (e.g. a proven visual impairment that prevents a representative from following oral proceedings on screen) and reasons related to the nature and subject-matter of the proceedings (e.g. where they involve the demonstration or inspection of an object where the haptic features are essential, to the extent that this is possible in accordance with the applicable provisions). Sweeping objections against the reliability of videoconferencing technology or the non-availability of videoconferencing equipment will, as a rule, not qualify as serious reasons in this regard.

Participants must ensure that their videoconferencing equipment meets the technical requirements specified. They are encouraged to perform a test call well before the oral proceedings take place.

In addition to the summons, participants will receive an email confirming the date, time and the videoconference contact details to be used to establish the connection (in the form of a link or by other suitable means) and containing any further appropriate information, including on the organisation of the videoconference.1.3 Request for oral proceedings to be held on EPO premises

A request that oral proceedings be held by way of exception on the premises of the EPO needs to be filed as early as possible, preferably together with the request for oral proceedings. The granting of a request for oral proceedings to be held on the premises of the EPO will be at the discretion of the competent division.

If the request for oral proceedings on the premises of the EPO cannot be allowed and is received after the summons to oral proceedings, the division will inform the parties that the oral proceedings will take place by videoconference as set out in the summons and include a brief reasoning as to why the request cannot be granted. If the request is received before the summons has been issued, the reasons for the refusal will be given in the annex to the summons. In either case, a refusal of this type is not separately appealable.

If a request for oral proceedings on the premises of the EPO is allowable and is received after the summons to oral proceedings by videoconference has been issued, the parties will be informed that oral proceedings will be held on the premises of the EPO as requested; where possible, the date of the oral proceedings will remain unchanged.1.4 Request to hold on-site oral proceedings at a particular site

A request to hold oral proceedings at a particular EPO site is not admissible; a refusal by the competent department to accept such a request is not subject to appeal (see T 1142/12).2. Oral proceedings at the request of a party

If, in the course of proceedings, a party requests oral proceedings, the competent department must grant this request as further explained in this section. The EPO will not inform any party concerned of this right but will expect them – if they do not obtain satisfaction from the competent department – to request oral proceedings (if they so wish) before a decision is reached.

Under Art. 116(1), parties can request oral proceedings at any time, provided a decision has not yet been issued. In particular, a request for oral proceedings made before the decision to grant or to limit has been handed over to the internal post has to be allowed (see T 556/95 and G 12/91).

Art. 116(1)

Oral proceedings will take place before the Receiving Section at the request of the applicant only where the Receiving Section considers this to be expedient or where it envisages refusing the European patent application. Where the Receiving Section does not consider it necessary to hold oral proceedings, it must inform the applicant accordingly (see J 16/02).

The competent department will decide on the most appropriate date for the oral proceedings, which will only be held after the issues to be determined are sufficiently clear (see E‑III, 5).

With a conditional request for oral proceedings, i.e. if any party concerned has indicated that the request for oral proceedings has been made solely as a precaution to cover the eventuality that the case they have put forward is not accepted, oral proceedings will be held only if a negative decision against the party concerned is envisaged.

With an unconditional request for oral proceedings, if the competent department considers that a decision on the matter may be reached on the basis of the written evidence on file and intends to take a decision (e.g. in accordance with Art. 97, Art. 101 or Art. 105b) which fully concurs with the case put forward by the party or parties having unconditionally requested the oral proceedings, and providing there is no valid request for oral proceedings from a party adversely affected by the decision envisaged, the decision may be issued in writing without oral proceedings being held (T 1050/09).

Art. 116(2)

2.1 Request for oral proceedings by an opponent whose opposition is to be rejected as inadmissible or is deemed not to have been filed2.1 Request for oral proceedings by an opponent whose opposition is to be rejected as inadmissible or is deemed not to have been filed

Under Art. 116(1), oral proceedings may be requested only by a party to pending proceedings. If the opposition division notes deficiencies in the notice of opposition under Rule 77(1), any opponent still remains a party to the proceedings until such time as their opposition is rejected as inadmissible. This also applies when deficiencies lead to the opposition being deemed not to have been filed (see D‑IV, 1.4.1).3. Request for further oral proceedings

The EPO may reject a request for further oral proceedings before the same department where the parties and the subject of the proceedings are the same, irrespective of the form in which the oral proceedings were held.

Oral proceedings, particularly in opposition proceedings, are held to give the opportunity to finally discuss all matters raised and are normally terminated with a decision announced orally. The division is bound by that decision, once announced, and it cannot reopen the proceedings to allow further submissions to be filed or to take into account new facts (see the last two paragraphs of E‑VI, 2). Only if the division, in the oral proceedings, has not announced a decision, but has decided to continue the proceedings in writing, can further submissions be examined. Such may be the case e.g. when the examining division indicates that it intends to grant a patent (or to limit a granted patent in limitation proceedings) on the basis of the documents filed during the oral proceedings.

Thus, as a rule, in examination, limitation or opposition proceedings there will be no justification for further oral proceedings, for example where one of the parties wishes to re-examine from a different viewpoint a subject already discussed in the course of the proceedings, either before or during the original oral proceedings. However, if the oral proceedings are not terminated with a decision and after the oral proceedings the subject of the proceedings changes, for example where fresh evidence is admitted into the proceedings after the original oral proceedings, then further oral proceedings will generally have to be held if requested (see T 194/96).

Art. 116(1)4. Oral proceedings at the instance of the EPO

The competent department of the EPO may arrange for oral proceedings to take place without a request from a party if it considers this to be expedient.

Oral proceedings will normally only be expedient if after an attempt at written clarification there are still questions or doubts which have a crucial bearing on the decision to be reached and which may be more efficiently or surely settled by oral discussion with the party or parties, or if it is necessary to take evidence as part of oral proceedings (see E‑IV, 1.3 and E-IV, 1.6.1). The competent department will also bear in mind the need for economy in such procedures, since oral proceedings give rise to costs for both the EPO and the party or parties.

Art. 116(1)5. Preparation of oral proceedings

The purpose of oral proceedings is to settle as far as possible all outstanding questions relevant to the decision. To this end proceedings will be carefully prepared after examination of all the written matter submitted and with this in mind the most appropriate date for conducting oral proceedings is chosen.

When preparing oral proceedings, particularly in opposition, the division considers carefully whether complex legal issues are likely to arise, and it may therefore decide to enlarge the division by adding a legally qualified member (Art. 18(2) and Art. 19(2)).

In so far as certain questions relevant to the decision are considered by the EPO to require discussion, it will in many cases be expedient to inform the party or parties in a notice and possibly also to invite one or more of the parties to submit written observations or to produce evidence, where appropriate. Parties may produce evidence in support of their arguments on their own initiative. Where, however, the evidence is such that it should have been put forward at an earlier stage, e.g. in opposition proceedings pursuant to D‑IV, 1.2.2.1(v) and D-IV, 5.4, it is for the competent body to consider whether the evidence not filed in due time is to be admitted (see E‑VI, 2). Any observations should be received in time for them to be communicated to the other parties at the latest one month before the oral proceedings. The time limit for submission of observations is fixed accordingly, particularly where the invitation to file observations is issued at the same time as the summons to oral proceedings.

5.1 When can a summons to oral proceedings be issued in substantive examination?5.1 When can a summons to oral proceedings be issued in substantive examination?

See C‑VIII, 5.1 for when a summons to oral proceedings can be issued in examination proceedings.

At the beginning of substantive examination, if the examining division is of the opinion that the application cannot be granted directly, at least one substantive communication within the meaning of Art. 94(3) will generally be sent before the division issues a summons to oral proceedings (see C‑III, 4).

In particular, neither the search opinion of an EESR or a supplementary search (ESOP) nor an opinion or report from the PCT procedure (WO-ISA, SISR, IPRP or IPER) is a communication under Art. 94(3), so that even if the applicant has replied thereto, it is in general not appropriate to send a summons as a first communication in European substantive examination.

Nor are the following communications/requests considered as substantive communications from the examining division for this purpose: invitation under Rule 62a or Rule 63, communication under Rule 137(4), request under Rule 53(3), request under Art. 124 and Rule 141, invitation under Rule 164(2)(a).

Exceptionally, summons to oral proceedings may be issued as the first action in examination proceedings, provided that the criteria set out in C‑III, 5 are met.

In examination proceedings, where the applicant has been invited to provide a translation of the priority according to Rule 53(3) (see A‑III, 6.8.2 and F‑VI, 3.4), no summons to oral proceedings will be issued until either the translation is provided or the period for further processing in respect of the time limit according to Rule 53(3) has expired.6. Summons to oral proceedings

All parties must be duly summoned to oral proceedings by notification. The summons must state the subject, the date and time and the form of the oral proceedings.

The division sets a single date for the oral proceedings, i.e. one day or, in particular cases, more than one consecutive day. No pre-announcement of the date will be made. Oral proceedings may be set for any working day on which the EPO is open at the relevant site.

Rule 115(1) Art. 119

The summons will be accompanied by a note drawing attention to the points which need to be discussed, normally containing the provisional and non-binding opinion of the division. New documents may be cited in the annex to the summons (T 120/12), together with an explanation of their significance. However, examiners must carefully consider on a case-by-case basis whether citing a new document would introduce a new line of argument. At an early stage in the procedure, they must consider sending a further communication before issuing any summons if a new document needs to be cited. For the additional requirements of the accompanying note if the summons is issued as the first action in examination, see C‑III, 5. The summons as well as the annexed communication can only be appealed together with the final decision unless a separate appeal is allowed (see E‑X, 3).

The summons will also fix a date up to which written submissions may be filed or amendments which meet the requirements of the EPC may be submitted (see also D‑VI, 3.2).

Rule 116(1)

Rule 115(1) stipulates that at least two months' notice of the summons must be given unless the parties agree to a shorter period. Such agreement must be present in the public part of the file.

Harmonised with the standards applied in the written procedure (E‑VIII, 1.2), the practice outlined below is followed in setting the date of the oral proceedings to allow the parties sufficient time for preparing and filing submissions:

(i)Any time limit (even shorter than two months) may be set provided that prior agreement has been reached with the parties.

(ii)Normally, the summons is issued at least four months ahead of the day of the oral proceedings in examination and at least six months ahead of the day of the oral proceedings in opposition.

(iii)Between two and four months' notice can be given without preliminary agreement only in specific circumstances, since the parties would have very limited time for filing submissions before the date fixed in the summons. Examples are where, in examination, the summons follows an extensive exchange between the first examiner and the applicant, where oral proceedings have been adjourned due to a lack of time, or where the date of the oral proceedings is changed to a later date (see also E‑III, 7.1.3).

(iv)Where the summons is issued as the first action in examination, six months are foreseen between the despatch of the summons and the date of the oral proceedings (see C‑III, 5).

The summons must state that if parties duly summoned do not appear as summoned or fail to connect to the oral proceeding by videoconference, as the case may be, the proceedings may continue without them.

In opposition proceedings, where multiple oppositions have been filed, as a rule, a single hearing in oral proceedings is scheduled, even if the oppositions are based on different grounds (see D‑I, 6). This means that all the parties must be summoned to attend them and may present comments on all grounds raised.

Rule 115(1)7. Change of date, cancellation or maintenance of oral proceedings

7.1 Changing the date of oral proceedings

7.2 Cancellation or maintenance of oral proceedings7.1 Changing the date of oral proceedings

7.1.1 Requests to change the date of oral proceedings

7.1.2 Change of date of oral proceedings at the instigation of the division

7.1.3 Change of date of oral proceedings – defined notice period7.1.1 Requests to change the date of oral proceedings

A request to change the date of oral proceedings is allowable only if the party concerned can advance serious reasons which justify the fixing of a new date (see T 1080/99, T 300/04, J 4/03 and T 178/03). The request to fix another date must be filed as soon as possible after the grounds preventing the party concerned from attending the oral proceedings have arisen. It must be accompanied by a sufficiently substantiated written statement indicating these reasons (see OJ EPO 2009, 68; see also T 178/03) and appropriate evidence, where necessary.

Serious reasons to request a change of the date for oral proceedings may be, for instance:

– a previously notified summons to oral proceedings of the same party in other proceedings before the EPO, the Unified Patent Court or a national court or patent office

– for the same date or

– for the preceding or following day or

– for at least one of the two preceding or two following days where participation in the oral proceedings requires travelling to or from a geographically distant location,

– serious illness,

– a death within the family,

– the marriage of a person whose attendance in oral proceedings is relevant,

– military service or other obligatory performance of civic duties,

– business trips which have been firmly booked before notification of the summons to oral proceedings,

– holidays which have already been firmly booked before notification of the summons to oral proceedings. In the case of holidays scheduled but not yet booked, the representative must indicate the circumstances (e.g. school holidays) which prevent the holidays from being rescheduled.

If the grounds for changing the date of the oral proceedings submitted by a party do not meet the above criteria, the division will inform the parties that the oral proceedings will take place as set out in the summons and annex a brief reasoning as to why in its view the criteria are not met.

The reasons that can be invoked to change the date only apply to those participants whose presence is essential to the oral proceedings, e.g. the representative or a witness.

If during the procedure substantive submissions were made by several representatives of a firm, an indication must be given why none of those who previously made such submissions can present the case at the oral proceedings, i.e. why the representative who cannot attend is essential or why the others are also unable to attend.

In opposition proceedings, in particular if more than one opponent is involved, a more strict approach may be applied to prevent a series of changes of date (see T 1102/03).

Grounds which, as a rule, are not acceptable are, for instance:

– a summons to oral proceedings before the EPO or a national court notified after the summons in the relevant proceedings,

– excessive work pressure.

As Mondays and Fridays are normal working days, oral proceedings will be scheduled for these days, too. The fact that this may necessitate travel at weekends is not a sufficient reason to change the date of the oral proceedings. The departments of first instance will however, circumstances permitting, try to be flexible where there is a request to change the starting time in order to enable the party to travel on the same day.7.1.2 Change of date of oral proceedings at the instigation of the division

In exceptional cases the division might have to instigate the change of date of oral proceedings for reasons similar to those mentioned above. The date of the oral proceedings will, however, be changed only if a suitable replacement cannot be found.7.1.3 Change of date of oral proceedings – defined notice period

The notice period defined in Rule 115(1), i.e. at least two months, is valid also in the case of a change of date unless the parties have agreed on a shorter period (see also E‑III, 6(iii) and E‑III, 8.11.1).7.2 Cancellation or maintenance of oral proceedings

7.2.1 General

7.2.2 Withdrawal of the request for oral proceedings7.2.1 General

In response to submissions made by a party in reply to the summons to oral proceedings, the division may also decide to cancel the oral proceedings and continue the procedure in writing. If it takes such a decision, it notifies the parties accordingly. In the absence of such notification, the parties must be aware that oral proceedings will be held. However, as an additional service in examination proceedings, if oral proceedings are not cancelled following such submissions, the division informs the applicant that the date and time set for the oral proceedings are maintained.7.2.2 Withdrawal of the request for oral proceedings

If the request for oral proceedings is explicitly withdrawn, or if a written statement is to be interpreted as equivalent to a withdrawal of the request for oral proceedings (because the party has indicated that it will not attend – see T 3/90, T 696/02 and T 1027/03 – or has requested a decision according to the state of the file – see OJ EPO 2020, A124), it is within the discretion of the division to decide whether the scheduled oral proceedings are to be maintained or to be cancelled.

If the division decides that oral proceedings are nevertheless to be conducted, this means that there are objections still outstanding that need to be discussed at the oral proceedings. Consequently the applicant and/or patentee can expect that problems relating to the requests filed in reply to the summons to oral proceedings will be dealt with at the oral proceedings.

If any applicant or patentee decides not to attend the oral proceedings, they are thereby choosing not to make use of the opportunity to comment at the oral proceedings on any of the objections, but to rely on the arguments as set out in the written submissions. The decision may be given orally in their absence. The procedural principles require that the party to the proceedings is not taken by surprise by the decision (see also E‑III, 8.3.3).8.

Oral proceedings before the Receiving Section, the examining divisions and the Legal Division are not public.

Art. 116(3)

Oral proceedings, including delivery of the decision (see E‑III, 9), are public before the opposition divisions in so far as the opposition division does not decide otherwise in cases where admission of the public could have serious and unjustified disadvantages, in particular for a party to the proceedings. This could, for example, be the case if any of the parties wishes to give information about sales figures or other commercial secrets in support of their case. Generally, the public will only be excluded whilst such information is being given. The public is also excluded during discussions about a request for exclusion of a document from file inspection (see D‑II, 4.3) and when a decision on the matter is pronounced. The parties other than the requester(s), as well as their representatives, may also be excluded as being part of the public (e.g. in the case of a request for exclusion of a medical certificate from file inspection).

Members of the public may be granted remote access to opposition oral proceedings via a link provided upon request. See OJ EPO 2022, A106, for details about the request and the conditions.

Art. 116(4)8.2 Conduct of oral proceedings

Before the Receiving Section oral proceedings will be conducted by the appointed officer and before the examining or opposition divisions by the chair of the division concerned. Before the Legal Division, oral proceedings will be conducted by one legally qualified member of the Legal Division.

The responsibilities of the person conducting the proceedings will include keeping order and conducting the proceedings as regards their formal and substantive aspects.

The person conducting the proceedings must in particular ensure that, where necessary, a list is prepared of all disputed or unclear points relevant to the decision to be reached, that these are discussed and that the party or parties have the opportunity of commenting on them. In the case of oral proceedings by videoconference, the person conducting them must ascertain that no technical problems have prevented the oral proceedings from being conducted in accordance with the right to be heard and the right to oral proceedings (see E‑III, 8.2.3).

On the other hand, the oral proceedings are to be conducted strictly and efficiently, so that the submissions of the party or parties and the discussions are not unnecessarily digressive and do not deal with points which are of no relevance to the decision to be reached. Repetition is to be avoided as far as possible. In particular, written material submitted at the appropriate time to the competent department and to the party or parties which has already been the subject of proceedings need not be read out in extenso. A simple reference to such written material may suffice.

The members of the examining and opposition divisions may equally connect to the oral proceedings by videoconference from different locations. In such cases, the members of the division will deliberate and vote among themselves via a separate communication channel. The venue of oral proceedings will be deemed to be the location where the division is set up.

The applicant or representative will be informed of the remote participation of the members of the division at the beginning of the oral proceedings, after the connection has been established and before they are formally opened.8.2.3 Technical problems

Where technical problems occur such that the oral proceedings held by videoconference cannot be conducted openly and fairly, for example due to a total or partial breakdown in communication, the right to be heard might possibly be violated (Art. 113(1)). The parties, due to the technical problems, might be taken by surprise by the grounds mentioned in an adverse decision on which they have not had an opportunity to comment.

If the sound or image transmission of any of the participants taking part in the oral proceedings is lost, the chair will stop the proceedings until the transmission is re-established.

If a participant is disconnected for more than a few minutes, a member of the division will contact that party to see if they are having technical problems. Any relevant information will be shared with all parties.

If a party reconnects after a temporary connection failure, the chair will make sure that no information has been missed. Some arguments might have to be repeated.

If, despite all efforts of the participants, technical problems prevent the oral proceedings by videoconference from being conducted in accordance with the parties' rights under Art. 113 and Art. 116, the videoconference will be terminated. A new summons to oral proceedings will be issued. As a rule, new oral proceedings will be held by videoconference unless there are serious reasons for not doing so (E‑III, 1.2).

OJ EPO 2022, A1038.2.4 Recording

The recording of oral proceedings by the parties is not permitted (see E‑III, 10.1). At the beginning of the videoconference, the chair will therefore remind all participants that recording of the videoconference is prohibited.8.3 Opening of oral proceedings; non-appearance of a party

8.3.1 Checking the identity and authorisations of participants at oral proceedings

8.3.2 Opening the oral proceedings

8.3.3 Late arrival, non-appearance and failure to connect8.3.1 Checking the identity and authorisations of participants at oral proceedings

The division will check the ID document of one representative or authorised employee of each party unless this person is personally known. For other representatives, authorised employees and accompanying persons (including those who will be making oral submissions, see E‑III, 8.5) present for a given party, it is sufficient that their identity is confirmed orally by the person whose ID documents were checked or who is personally known to at least one member of the division. This applies independently of whether a representative is a professional representative or a legal practitioner. Equally, if a party is not represented but personally present together with an accompanying person, it is sufficient to check the ID document of that party.

However, the division checks the ID documents of all parties, witnesses and experts summoned to give evidence before the EPO. Moreover, the division may check ID documents of other attendees where this is considered necessary, e.g. because the identity of an accompanying person is challenged by another party or where the division has serious doubts about the identity of the person.

The identity document may be presented in one of following ways:

– If the identity document is an EPO badge, by showing it to the camera at the beginning of the videoconference in the public meeting room.

– If the identity document is a national ID card or passport, by showing it to a member of the division in a separate non-public meeting room.

– By sending a copy to the email address provided to the parties at the beginning of the oral proceedings.

– By using the EPO online filing options up to two days prior to the oral proceedings.

For data protection reasons, copies of identification documents sent by email are deleted and not included in the file; copies submitted via the EPO online filing options are placed in the non-public part of the file.

In order for the division to be able to confirm the identity of the person concerned, the full name (first name and surname) and the picture of the ID should be visible. All the other information on the identity document can be kept hidden if so wished, as long as it is possible to recognise that it is an official identity document.

Professional representatives need to file authorisations only in exceptional cases (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, L.1).

Authorisations need be checked only if a party is represented by a person whose authorisation is not apparent from the file. If it is established that the person is either

(i)a professional representative acting under a sub-authorisation

(ii)a professional representative from the same agency as the representative acting in the case, or

(iii)a natural person (e.g. executive director) authorised by law in the party's country of business to act on behalf of that party

then no further check is required.

If however the person is:

(a)a professional representative who is neither from the same agency nor acting under a sub-authorisation, and his/her attendance at the oral proceedings is his/her first appearance in the procedure, or

(b)a legal practitioner or a party's employee who is not an authorised professional representative

then the procedure is as follows:

In case (a), the division will check the file to see whether the previous representative's authorisation has lapsed. A change in representative or the termination of the authorisation of a previous representative may have been effected via an electronic notification through the My Files service (see OJ EPO 2012, 352). If the previous representative's authorisation has lapsed, no further action is required. If not, the representative concerned will be requested to provide a reference to a registered general authorisation or to file an individual authorisation.

In case (b), the division will request the person concerned to provide a reference to a registered general authorisation or to file – by email in the case of oral proceedings by videoconference (OJ EPO 2020, A71) – an individual authorisation.

Any person without an authorisation will be requested to submit one without delay. If they are unable to do so straight away, a time limit of two months will be set for its submission. The fact that the authorisation was missing, and the time limit set for submitting it, must be recorded in the minutes. The proceedings then continue in the normal way, except that no decision can be pronounced at the end. Instead, the decision is issued in writing once the missing authorisation has been filed. At the end of the proceedings, the party concerned must be reminded to file the authorisation.8.3.2 Opening the oral proceedings

After opening the oral proceedings any person conducting them will introduce the parties present. They will have the particulars of the persons taking part in the proceedings recorded and will establish in what capacity they are present. Details of these steps and any consequences thereof will be recorded in the minutes (see E‑III, 10).8.3.3 Late arrival, non-appearance and failure to connect

8.3.3.1 General

8.3.3.2 Procedure in opposition proceedings

8.3.3.3 Procedure in examination proceedings8.3.3.1 General

If an absent party was not duly summoned, this is noted in the minutes and the oral proceedings are closed. A new date must be fixed for further oral proceedings.

If any party who has been duly summoned to oral proceedings does not appear as summoned or fails to connect to the oral proceedings by videoconference, as the case may be, the oral proceedings may be conducted without them, since a party should not be able to delay issuance of a decision by failing to appear or connect.

It is to be noted that if any party appears or connects before the end of the oral proceedings, they have the right to be heard.

If the party appears or connects only after the proceedings have been closed, the division may reopen them at its discretion, subject to two conditions:

(a)the division has not pronounced a decision under Art. 97(1) or (2) or Art. 101(2) or an interlocutory decision under Art. 106(2) maintaining the patent in amended form according to Art. 101(3) (see also D‑VI, 7.2.2) or a decision to reject the request for limitation under Rule 95(4).

(b)all parties to the proceedings agree to the reopening.

Rule 115(2)

If, however, an allowable request for a change of date of oral proceedings has been filed (see E‑III, 7.1.1), the proceedings are postponed and a new date fixed. If the filing of the request was delayed due to the carelessness of the party concerned, the proceedings may, depending on the circumstances, still be postponed; if this happens in opposition proceedings, a decision on the apportionment of costs may have to be taken (see D‑IX, 1.4).

Art. 104(1)8.3.3.2 Procedure in opposition proceedings

If new facts or evidence are submitted during inter partes oral proceedings which a party, although duly summoned, fails to attend, it must first be examined whether these submissions may be disregarded (Art. 114(2); see also E‑VI, 2).

Following G 4/92, if new facts are taken into consideration, then at the end of the oral proceedings a decision based on these facts cannot be taken against the absent party. Further, new evidence can only be used against the absent party if it has been previously notified and merely supports the previous assertions of the party who submits it. However, new arguments may be used at any time, in so far as they do not change the grounds on which the decision is based.

In other words, what the Enlarged Board of Appeal ruled out in G 4/92 was the possibility of taking decisions against the absent party on the basis of a surprising course of events at the oral proceedings, which changes the legal and factual framework of the case in an unforeseeable way (see T 414/94).

An absent party cannot be considered taken by surprise if during oral proceedings the other side attempts to overcome objections raised before the oral proceedings. In particular, a submission during oral proceedings of a more restricted and/or formally amended set of claims with a view to overcoming the objections of the opponent is not considered a "new fact" (see T 133/92 and T 202/92). Nor is it unexpected that amended claims are examined for formal admissibility and for compliance with Art. 123(2) and Art. 123(3) (see T 341/92).

In the particular case of an absent opponent, if new prior art is submitted for the first time during oral proceedings which may be an obstacle to the maintenance of the opposed patent, this new prior art can be taken into consideration despite the opponent's absence because it is in the opponent's favour (see T 1049/93).8.3.3.3 Procedure in examination proceedings

Oral proceedings give applicants an opportunity to exercise their rights under Art. 113(1). In examination proceedings, when applicants file amended claims before oral proceedings which they subsequently do not attend, they may expect a decision based on objections which might arise against such claims in their absence. A decision can be taken based on facts and arguments presented earlier in the proceedings and/or based on new arguments which may be expected to be raised (see OJ EPO 2008, 471).

In examination proceedings, the annex to the summons to oral proceedings must include all the objections that are likely to be discussed during oral proceedings and indicate that amended claims in response to the communication will have to be examined at the oral proceedings for compliance with the EPC. This ensures that the applicant's right to be heard (Art. 113(1)) is respected and that the proceedings are not delayed unnecessarily if an applicant does not attend oral proceedings.

Where auxiliary requests are filed before the summons to oral proceedings is issued, these requests must be commented on in terms of both admissibility and allowability. However, the reasoning given in the preliminary opinion is to focus on the main request; only a brief indication of the essential reasons for the non-allowability of the subject-matter or the non-admissibility of the auxiliary requests is to be provided. It is to be noted that this brief indication of the essential reasons for not allowing or not admitting the auxiliary requests has to be thorough enough to ensure that the applicant has been informed of the objections raised by the examining division and has thus been given the opportunity to comment on them (see C‑V, 1.1 and C‑V, 4.7.1.1).8.4 Opening of the substantive part of the proceedings

In so far as necessary, the person conducting the proceedings will outline the stage reached in the proceedings and will indicate the most important matters in dispute according to the file. In examination or opposition proceedings this may also be done by the primary examiner.8.5 Submissions by the parties

After the introduction referred to above, the party or parties will be allowed the floor in order to put their cases and to make applications on procedural matters and state the grounds thereof. In the normal course of events each party will have only one opportunity of making a comprehensive statement.

In opposition proceedings the opponents will generally speak first and the patent proprietor afterwards. Where there are a number of opponents, it may be expedient to grant the patent proprietor an opportunity of replying directly after the statement of each individual opponent. The opponents and the patent proprietor will be given the opportunity of making a final reply.

The submissions of the party or parties may be prepared in writing, although they are expected to be made extemporaneously as far as possible. Passages from documents already introduced into the proceedings which are referred to again may only be read out where their precise wording is relevant.

Submissions by a person who is not qualified under Art. 133 and Art. 134 to represent parties to proceedings before the EPO may be admitted at oral proceedings when this person accompanies a professional representative representing that party. Such submissions, however, cannot be made as a matter of right, but only with the permission and at the discretion of the examining or opposition division or the Legal Division. In opposition proceedings the division will consider in exercising its discretion whether (see G 4/95):

(i)the party on behalf of which the person is to speak has filed a request to this effect;

(ii)the party making the request has indicated the name of the person, the subject-matter of the submission and the person's qualification to speak on this matter;

(iii)the request has been filed sufficiently in advance of the oral proceedings;

(iv)in the case of a late-filed request, either there are exceptional circumstances justifying the admission of the submission or all the other parties agree to the making of the submission; and

(v)the submissions are made under the continuing responsibility and control of the professional representative.

If neither of the alternative conditions mentioned under (iv) are met, a late-filed request will be refused. The time limit to be applied when deciding whether a request was late-filed is that fixed in the summons under Rule 116.

If a party is represented by an authorised employee rather than a professional representative, the same considerations apply in respect of a person accompanying the authorised employee. As no other party is affected, examining divisions can adopt a more liberal approach than opposition divisions.

Parties are not to be considered as accompanying persons in the sense of G 4/95 (see T 621/98). They have the right to make submissions in oral proceedings by virtue of their status as party to the proceedings.

If written submissions are made during oral proceedings, the division will make sure that requirements such as typed-form, signature and dating of the submissions are met (T 733/99). See also E‑III, 8.7 and OJ EPO 2020, A71.

8.5.1 Use of computer-generated slideshows in oral proceedings

8.5.2 Written submissions during oral proceedings by videoconference8.5.1 Use of computer-generated slideshows in oral proceedings

In oral proceedings a computer-generated slideshow cannot be used as a matter of right, but only with the permission of and at the discretion of the examining or opposition division or the Legal Division (T 1556/06), and, in the case of oral proceedings on the EPO premises, if the necessary equipment is available in the room in which the oral proceedings are held. Generally, screens are available in most meeting rooms; however, requests to provide further equipment such as projectors will be refused.

Care must be taken that presentations of computer-generated slideshows do not negatively impact the efficient conduct of oral proceedings (e.g. interruptions for the technical preparations for the presentation). Similar considerations apply to the use of other visual aids (e.g. flipcharts, pictures, screensharing).

8.5.1.1 Opposition proceedings (inter partes)

8.5.1.2 Examination proceedings (ex parte)8.5.1.1 Opposition proceedings (inter partes)

As a prerequisite, copies of the material to be presented must be provided in good time before the oral proceedings, i.e. Rule 116 applies. These copies are treated like any other submission made in writing.

The opposition division will decide whether the presentation of a computer-generated slideshow would facilitate the proceedings, after having heard the parties and taking into account whether allowing or refusing the use of the presentation would be detrimental to any participant.

A balance must be found between the presenter's interest in defending the case in the most appropriate manner and the other party's need to fully understand the submissions made and to have a true opportunity to respond.

The presentation of computer-generated slideshows in oral proceedings will be allowed if in the absence of this visual aid it would be much more difficult to follow the party's submissions. For example, slides showing:

(a)the structure or functioning of a product which is complex, or

(b)complicated reaction schemes,

(c)complex formulae, or

(d)the operation of a complex apparatus

might be considered by the opposition division to facilitate the discussion.

If copies of the material to be presented have not been filed in good time, or if the slides contain new matter, the presentation may be disregarded under Art. 114(2) and Rule 116. In this case the opposition division will apply the same criteria for admissibility as are used for other late-filed facts or evidence (see E‑VI, 2).

The same considerations apply to oral proceedings before the Legal Division where they constitute inter partes proceedings.8.5.1.2 Examination proceedings (ex parte)

As no other party is affected, examining divisions may adopt a more liberal approach than opposition divisions. Therefore, examining divisions will consider allowing the presentation of a computer-generated slideshow even if the slides are not communicated in advance of the oral proceedings, provided that:

(a)the examining division feels able to deal with this late-filed material without unduly lengthening the proceedings. The same considerations as for other late-filed facts and evidence apply (see E‑VI, 2);

(b)the submissions contribute to the resolution of the questions at issue.

The same considerations apply to oral proceedings before the Legal Division where they constitute ex parte proceedings.8.5.2 Written submissions during oral proceedings by videoconference

Where oral proceedings are held as a videoconference, documents filed subsequently as referred to in Rule 50 must be filed by email (OJ EPO 2020, A71, Art. 1(1)). This also applies to authorisations.

Where filed documents require signature, this signature may be is preferably applied to the attached document. or Alternatively, to it may appear in the text of the accompanying email., which will also be annexed to the minutes. The signature must take the form of a string of characters (such as an email signature with the sender's name and position) or a facsimile signature.

OJ EPO 2020, A71, Art. 2

The documents are to be sent to the email address indicated during the videoconference by the competent department.

OJ EPO 2020, A71, Art. 3

Any emails and attached documents filed by a party during oral proceedings with more than one party will be forwarded by the division to the other parties present at the proceedings unless the party in question has already sent them direct to the email address indicated by the other parties. Therefore, each party must communicate to the chair division and, where possible, to the other parties at the beginning of the oral proceedings the email address it wishes to use for receiving copies of such documents. Parties and representatives must ensure that they can immediately take note of any document sent to the email address indicated by them.

OJ EPO 2022, A106

Amended application documents are to be filed as attachments. Attachments containing these amended application documents must be in PDF format and must comply with the WIPO Standard for Filing and Processing in Electronic Form (Annex F of the Administrative Instructions under the PCT). Where an attachment containing these amended application documents is not in PDF format or does not comply with the WIPO Standard or is illegible or incomplete, the party must be promptly informed during the videoconference. Where the deficiencies cannot be remedied during the videoconference or within the time limit set, that document (or that part of the document which is illegible or incomplete) is deemed not to have been received.

Other attachments may be sent in any format which can be opened by the division or (in the case of consultations) the examiner and which can be reproduced in a legible form. Otherwise they are deemed not to have been filed.

If an attachment is infected with a computer virus or contains other malicious software, it will be deemed to be illegible. The EPO is not obliged to receive, open or process any such attachment.

OJ EPO 2020, A71, Art. 4

No paper documents need be filed to confirm documents filed by email.

OJ EPO 2020, A71, Art. 5

All submissions made by email during a videoconference must be annexed to the minutes unless the exceptions under Rule 144 and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 2007 concerning documents excluded from file inspection apply (see A‑XI, 2.3 and Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, J.3). A confidentiality note which is routinely included in emails is not to be regarded as a request to exclude these submissions from the public file.

OJ EPO 2020, A71, Art. 6

If the division consents, a party may present its screen for illustrative purposes. An item displayed in that way will not be considered as a document submitted by that party.

OJ EPO 2022, A1068.6 Facts, evidence or amendments introduced at a late stage

With respect to facts, evidence or amendments not submitted in due time or arguments presented at a late stage in the proceedings, including during oral proceedings, see E‑VI, 2.8.7 Handwritten amendments in oral proceedings

8.7.1 General principles

8.7.2 Procedure in examination proceedings

8.7.3 Procedure in opposition proceedings8.7.1 General principles

The requirement of Art. 2(7) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 that the description, claims and abstract, as well as the request for grant, must be typed or printed in principle extends to documents replacing application documents and to amended patent specification documents (see also A‑III, 3.2).

Responsibility for formally correct submissions and, in particular, for compliance with these requirements lies with the applicant/proprietor.

It is to be noted that deletions, Deletions, correction of the numbering of the figures and insertion of reference numbers and associated arrows in drawings are considered as typewritten amendments.

If the oral proceedings take place by way of exception In order to assist the parties, including parties using their own laptops or other electronic devices during oral proceedings on the premises of the EPO, the parties may use the EPO provides EPO's technical facilities that allow for compliance with the formal requirements, in particular computers equipped with a word processor and a printer, network printers and copiers enabling documents to be printed from a USB stick, and internet access in public areas via a public wireless network (see OJ EPO 2013, 603).

Parties are recommended to prepare electronic copies of documents likely to be amended. Published patent applications and specifications are available via the European publication server. See D‑IV, 5.3 for the preferred way to amend the description in opposition proceedings.

For the procedures in examination and opposition oral proceedings, see E‑III, 8.7.2 and E-III, 8.7.3 respectively.

Rules 50(1) and 86

Rule 49(2)

OJ EPO 2022, A1138.7.2 Procedure in examination proceedings

In examination proceedings, the formal requirements prescribed by the President under Rule 49(2) apply equally to application documents submitted during oral proceedings by email or by hand.

Documents containing handwritten amendments will normally be accepted by the division as a basis for discussion during oral proceedings until agreement is reached on the final text of the patent. However, a final decision granting a patent may be taken only on the basis of documents which are formally compliant.

If the applicant is unable to provide formally correct amended application documents during oral proceedings, the following applies:

(a)If a decision to refuse a patent application is imminent and formally non-compliant documents making up the application are on file, to avoid prolonging the proceedings the examining division will go ahead and issue the decision, based on substantive arguments. It may however mention this formal deficiency in the decision.

(b)If there is agreed patentable subject-matter, the examining division announces the following:

– the amended application fulfils the requirements of the EPC except for certain formal requirements, e.g. the ones regarding handwritten amendments; and

– the procedure will be continued in writing.

After the closure of the oral proceedings, the formalities officer on behalf of the examining division (see A‑III, 3.2) will invite the applicant to file formally correct documents within two months. Where the amendments submitted in reply to this invitation differ from the patentable subject-matter established at the oral proceedings, the procedure described in C‑V, 4.7 is to be applied.

OJ EPO 2022, A1138.7.3 Procedure in opposition proceedings

The preferred way to amend the description during oral proceedings in opposition is by submitting amended paragraphs replacing specific numbered paragraphs of the B-publication of the patent. This allows the opposition division and the opponents to verify the amendments efficiently. It is not necessary to supply entire amended pages.

Rule 82(2), third sentence, provides for one exception to the principle that a decision determining the final text of the patent may be based only on formally compliant documents. Pursuant to this provision, in oral opposition proceedings, the patent proprietor is by way of exception not required to file documents compliant with the requirements of Art. 2(7) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 (OJ EPO 2022, A113) prior to the interlocutory decision on the documents on the basis of which the patent is to be maintained. The proprietor may choose to submit a formally compliant version of the amended text only within the time limit under Rule 82(2) (OJ EPO 2016, A22). The parties will nevertheless be encouraged to file compliant documents during oral opposition proceedings.

In contrast, in written opposition proceedings, an interlocutory decision to maintain the patent as amended may be issued only on the basis of formally compliant documents since the invitation in Rule 82(2) applies only to documents filed during oral proceedings (see H‑IV, 5.3).

If, in oral proceedings, the interlocutory decision of the opposition division was based on documents which do not comply with Art. 2(7) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, i.e. which contain handwritten amendments, the opposition division will invite the proprietor in the communication under Rule 82(2) to file a formally compliant version of the amended text. The invitation will specify the formally deficient amended paragraphs and/or claims for which replacement paragraphs and/or claims need to be filed. The same applies where a decision of the boards of appeal remits the case to the department of first instance with the order to maintain the patent on the basis of amended documents with handwritten amendments.

In reply to the invitation of the opposition division under Rule 82(2) the proprietor will have to submit replacement paragraphs and/or claims which contain a formally compliant verbatim reproduction of the text as determined by the interlocutory decision (or the decision of the board of appeal). Any divergence between the text matter of the formally deficient paragraphs (and/or claims) specified in the invitation under Rule 82(2) and the text of the replacement paragraphs (and/or claims) will trigger a communication under Rule 82(3). A communication under Rule 82(3) will also be sent, if the proprietor does not reply at all or not in time, if the replacement paragraphs and/or claims are incomplete or if the replacement paragraphs and/or claims are again formally deficient.

If a formally compliant version of the verbatim text of the specified amended paragraphs (and/or claims) is not submitted within two months from the notification of the communication under Rule 82(3), the patent will be revoked.8.8 Use of Rule 137(4) for amendments filed during oral proceedings in examination

A communication under Rule 137(4) will not be sent in respect of amendments filed during oral proceedings (see H‑III, 2.1.3), since this would unduly delay the procedure. Making a request under Rule 137(4) during oral proceedings would have the consequence of staying the proceedings for one month, while waiting for the applicant's answer.

The examining division therefore requests the applicants to provide a basis for any amendments submitted during oral proceedings before any new amendments can be admitted into the proceedings.

In special cases, e.g. where there are many auxiliary requests which are difficult to check for compliance with the requirements of Art. 123(2) and the requests do not comply with Rule 137(4), the examining division may exercise its discretion by not admitting these requests under Rule 137(3) rather than raising an objection under Rule 137(4) (see H‑II, 2.3 and H‑III, 3.3.2.1).8.9 Discussion of the facts and of the legal position

A discussion will be conducted with the party or parties concerning those technical or legal questions which are relevant to the decision and which, after the parties have made their submissions, do not appear to have been sufficiently clarified or discussed or are seemingly contradictory. Where necessary, it must be ensured that the party or parties file requests which are to the point and that the applicant or proprietor formulates the claims appropriately.

If the examining division finds that some patentable subject-matter results from an amendment of the claims, it informs the applicant of the fact and allows him an opportunity to submit amended claims based thereon.

If the competent department intends to depart from a previous legal assessment of the situation with which the parties are acquainted or from a prevailing legal opinion, or if facts or evidence already introduced into the proceedings are seen in a different light – e.g. during the deliberations of the examining or opposition division (see E‑III, 8.11) – so that the case takes a significant turn, the parties must be informed thereof.8.10 Right of the other members of the division to put questions

The chair must allow any member of the examining or opposition division who so requests to put questions. They may determine at which point in the proceedings such questions may be put.

In oral proceedings, questions may be put to the parties in connection with their statements or the discussion of the facts or of the legal position. When evidence is taken as part of oral proceedings questions may also be put to the witnesses, parties and experts called. As regards the right of the parties to put questions, see E‑IV, 1.6.7.8.11 Closure of oral proceedings

If the competent department considers that the matter has been sufficiently thoroughly discussed, it must decide on the subsequent procedure to be followed. Where the department consists of a number of members – as in the case of the examining or opposition divisions – they must, if necessary, deliberate on the matter in the absence of the parties. Where oral proceedings are held by videoconferences and the members connect to the oral proceedings from different locations (see E‑III, 8.2.2), the members will deliberate and vote among themselves via a separate communication channel. If new aspects emerge during the discussion and require further questions to be put to the parties, the proceedings may be restarted. Any person conducting the proceedings may thereafter give the decision of the department. Otherwise they inform the party or parties of the subsequent procedure and then close the oral proceedings.

While the department is bound by the decision it issues on substantive matters (see E‑III, 9), it is free, as a result of further reflection, to inform the parties that it intends to depart from the procedure which it has announced.

The subsequent procedure may, for example, consist in the department issuing a further communication, imposing certain requirements on one of the parties, or informing the parties that it intends to grant or maintain the patent in an amended form. As regards the delivery of a decision in the last case, see E‑III, 9.

If the patent is to be granted or maintained in an amended form, it is the aim to reach an agreement upon the final text in the oral proceedings. If, however, by way of exception the examining or opposition division indicates during the oral proceedings that it would be willing to grant or maintain a European patent provided that certain amendments are made which could not reasonably have been foreseen from the earlier procedure, the applicant or patent proprietor will be given a time limit of normally two to four months in which to submit such amendments. If the applicant or patent proprietor fails to do so, the application will be refused or the patent will be revoked.

8.11.1 Requesting postponement during oral proceedings

8.11.2 Adjournment of oral proceedings due to lack of time8.11.1 Requesting postponement during oral proceedings

Oral proceedings in examination, limitation or opposition are intended to bring the proceedings to a close, and parties are expected to prepare themselves fully.

The division will therefore normally refuse any request from a party that the proceedings be postponed or continued in writing.

Even if the description needs to be revised to bring it into conformity with amended claims, the applicant or proprietor is expected to make the necessary changes either in the oral proceedings or during a break.8.11.2 Adjournment of oral proceedings due to lack of time

If possible, oral proceedings should not last more than eight working hours. However, they may be extended slightly if an imminent conclusion seems likely. If not, the chair terminates the discussions for that day at an appropriate point to allow time for possible arrangement of a new date. Continuing oral proceedings on a day other than the one set out in the summons requires a new summons with a notice period of at least two months according to Rule 115(1) to be issued unless all parties agree to a shorter period of notice. See E‑III, 6 for the general practice adopted for setting the date of oral proceedings. The explicit agreement of all parties is necessary and must be recorded in the minutes.

The new summons must indicate the points that still need to be discussed during the upcoming oral proceedings (Rule 116(1)). It is at the discretion of the division whether to indicate the points that are closed or to provide a provisional opinion on the points that are still open. A new final date for making submissions is not fixed under Rule 116 in the new summons if the subject of the proceedings has not changed (see E‑VI, 2.2.2). Otherwise, a new date is fixed under Rule 116 and at least two months' notice is given under Rule 115 unless the parties agree to a shorter period. The minutes of the oral proceedings which took place are to be issued in advance of the upcoming oral proceedings, preferably no later than when the new summons is issued.

If the agreed date is too close for the parties to be able to receive the new summons in time (e.g. the next day or a day in the same week), it is necessary that the parties waive their right to receive a new summons. The respective statements of the parties must also be recorded in the minutes.9. Delivery of the decision

The delivery of the decision will follow a statement by the person conducting the proceedings announcing the operative part of the decision (see also E‑III, 8.11 and E‑X, 2.3).

The operative part may, for example, read as follows:

"The patent application ... is refused." or

"The opposition to the patent ... is rejected." or

"The patent ... is revoked." or

"Taking account of the amendments made by the proprietor in the opposition proceedings, the patent and the invention to which it relates satisfy the requirements of the Convention." or

"The request for limitation of the patent .... is allowable." or

"The request for limitation of the patent .... is rejected." or

"Patent grant proceedings relating to European patent application No. ... are interrupted/resumed as from ..."

Once a decision has been pronounced, submissions of the party or parties cannot be considered any longer and the decision stands, subject to the correction of errors in accordance with Rule 140. It may only be amended by appeal (see E‑XII, 1, E‑XII, 7 and E‑XII, 8).

No pronouncement need be made at this point as to the reasons for the decision or the possibility of appeal. However, the examining or opposition division may give a short explanation of the reasons for the decision.

Subsequently the decision in writing (see E‑X) containing the reasoning and information as to right of appeal must be notified to the parties without undue delay. The period for appeal will only begin to run from the date of notification of the written decision.

Generally speaking it will not be possible to give a decision granting a European patent or maintaining it in amended or limited form in oral proceedings since, in the case of the grant of a patent, the requirements laid down in Rule 71(3) to Rule 71(7), and in the case of a patent being maintained in amended or limited form, the requirements of Rule 82(1) and Rule 82(2) or Rule 95(3) must be fulfilled.

The division further ensures that the result of oral proceedings in opposition is made available to the public online immediately after the hearing. If the patent is maintained on the basis of amendments filed during oral proceedings, these amendments are made public as well.

Rule 111(1) and Rule 111(2)10. Minutes of oral proceedings

As regards the minutes of taking of evidence, see E‑IV, 1.7.

10.1 Formal requirements

10.2 Language

10.3 Subject-matter of minutes

10.4 Request for correction of minutes10.1 Formal requirements

Minutes of oral proceedings must be drawn up.

The person conducting the proceedings must ensure that during the whole proceedings an employee is available to keep minutes. If necessary, during oral proceedings different employees may carry out the task of minute-writing in sequence. In this case it must be made clear in the minutes which section was drawn up by which employee. The employees are normally members of the competent department, e.g. the examining or opposition division. Following the proceedings, the minutes are formatted.

Rule 124(1)

The minutes must be authenticated by the employee responsible for drawing them up and by the employee who conducted the oral proceedings, either by signature or by other appropriate means. If exceptionally the employee responsible cannot sign the minutes, one of the other members of the division may sign them on the employee's behalf subject to the conditions defined in E‑X, 2.3. They are not signed by the parties. The parties must be provided with a copy of the minutes. Copies must be notified to them as soon as possible after the oral proceedings.

Provided the parties have been informed, the EPO may make sound recordings of the oral proceedings. However, no person other than an EPO employee is allowed to make any recording or retransmit any part of the oral proceedings, whether image or sound or both (see OJ EPO 1986, 63, OJ EPO 2022, A106).

Sound recordings are made only in specific exceptional circumstances, for example if the division expects

(a)witness testimony

(b)complex proceedings (e.g. because of the subject-matter or number of parties)

(c)requests for amendments to the minutes because of the importance of the case.

Sound recordings are made only in the case of taking of evidence (E‑IV, 1.7). The recording is kept until the end of any possible proceedings. Copies of the recording will not be provided to the parties.

The minutes must first include the date of the proceedings, the names of the members of the department, e.g. the opposition division, present and the name or names of the minute-writer or writers. Minutes must also include the details referred to in E‑III, 10.3.

Rule 124(3) and Rule 124(4)10.2 Language

The minutes are normally written in the language of the proceedings under Art. 14(3), i.e. the EPO official language in which the application was filed or into which it was translated. The exceptions are set out in Rule 4(6).

Amendments to the text of the description or claims of the application or patent must be recorded in the minutes in the language of the proceedings under Art. 14(3).

Where the exact wording is important, or if the parties so insist, the minutes must record the following, word for word, in the EPO official language actually used or into which the statements were translated, as provided for in Rule 4(6):

(a)requests of the parties

(b)legally relevant statements by parties, witnesses, experts and division members, and

(c)order of the decision.

The term "statement" within the meaning of Rule 4(6) is to be interpreted narrowly as the exception to the rule of using the language of proceedings in the written procedure rather than as allowing the recording of all arguments made in another official language during the oral proceedings.

For derogations from the language of proceedings see E‑V, 6.

See E‑III, 10.3 for requests for recording specific statements in the minutes.10.3 Subject-matter of minutes

Minutes have an important function as evidence of respect for the right to be heard (Art. 113(1)). They must contain the essentials of the oral proceedings and the relevant statements made by the parties, together with arguments relevant to the decision and not contained in the parties' written submissions. Details of the arguments raised by the parties, however, are developed in the decision, and therefore are only briefly reported in the minutes.

Relevant statements are, for example, new or amended procedural submissions or the withdrawal thereof, the fresh submission or amendment or withdrawal of application documents, such as claims, description and drawings, and statements of surrender.

The essentials of the oral proceedings include new statements by the party or parties and by the member or members of the department concerning the subject-matter of the proceedings. In examination and opposition proceedings, the essentials are principally new statements arguing the presence or lack of novelty, inventive step and other patentability criteria. The minutes are not, however, expected to be an exhaustive recollection of everything that was said during the oral proceedings. Rather, they are limited to the essentials and are as brief and concise as possible.

Vague or general statements are to be avoided. Also, care must be taken to ensure that statements crucial to the decision are correctly recorded. Although this is normally not necessary, in case of doubt the record of such statements is read out to the parties concerned before the decision is taken and announced.

Requests from parties for recording specific statements are accepted if the statements form part of the essentials of the oral proceedings and are relevant for reaching the decision. Otherwise, they may be refused since recording statements that a party considers might be useful in subsequent proceedings is not the function of the minutes. See E‑III, 10.2 for the language requirements.

If new facts or evidence are submitted during the oral proceedings, the minutes must make clear that the division has examined them under Art. 114(1). They must also indicate whether or not the division, after having heard the parties, subsequently disregarded them under Art. 114(2).

The minutes briefly summarise the following elements, where present:

(a)arguments relevant for the decision as submitted by the parties, which, if they are already known from the written procedure, can be referred to as such,

(b)the substance of any new requests by the parties, preferably in the form of a brief statement referring to documents containing these requests, which must be attached to the minutes, and

(c)objections, arguments and/or requests to the parties voiced by a member of the division, focusing on the points relevant for the decision which are developed in the grounds for the decision.

The minutes conclude by indicating the decision taken by the division or, if no final decision is taken, the outcome of the proceedings. This part is preceded by a record of the parties' final requests as indicated in point (b) above.

The minutes must also contain procedural information, such as how the proceedings are to be continued after closure of the oral proceedings or whether the public was excluded for the whole or part of the oral proceedings.

The structure of the minutes mirrors the course of oral proceedings (see E‑III, 8 and sub-points).

If a decision is given (see E‑III, 9), it must be reproduced in the minutes.

The minutes with the result reached during the proceedings are communicated to the parties as soon as possible.

Art. 113(1) Rule 124(1)10.4 Request for correction of minutes

If a party to oral proceedings considers the minutes thereof not to fulfil the requirements of Rule 124, it may file a request to that effect, with a proposed correction, as soon as possible after receipt of the minutes in question.

The examining/opposition division is competent to decide upon the request (T 1198/97, T 68/02 and T 231/99). In response to a request for correction the division will either issue corrected minutes of the oral proceedings or despatch a communication stating that the minutes already contain the essentials of the oral proceedings and the relevant statements of the parties and give reasoning thereto (see T 819/96). The communication from the division cannot on its own be subject to an appeal. If the request for correction is filed within the period for filing the grounds for appeal, the division will make every effort to deal with it promptly to the extent possible so that the party can refer to the communication in the appeal.

It is at the discretion of the writer of the minutes (and of the chair who authenticates them) to decide what is considered essential and relevant in the meaning of Rule 124(1) (T 212/97). The minutes are corrected when they show deficiencies with regard to the aspects mentioned, for example if essential submissions or similarly important procedural statements are missing, or if they are incorrectly reflected in the minutes (T 231/99, T 642/97 and T 819/96).Chapter IV – Taking and conservation of evidence

1.12 Video recordings1.1 General remarks

Formal taking of evidence in accordance with Rule 117 will occur mainly in opposition proceedings and hardly ever before the examining division. The following sections of this chapter are therefore based primarily on opposition proceedings. However, they also apply mutatis mutandis to other proceedings and particularly to substantive examination.

Art. 117 Rule 1171.2 Means of evidence

The party or parties may at any time during proceedings submit evidence in support of alleged facts (see E‑III, 5, E‑X, 1.2, D‑IV, 5.3, D‑IV, 5.4 and D‑VI, 3). This must be done at the earliest opportunity. When such evidence is such as could have been put forward at an earlier stage it is for the competent department to consider whether it is expedient (see E‑VI, 2) to allow the new evidence to be introduced.

It is generally desirable for parties to produce evidence in respect of all the facts alleged in support of their case, in order, for example, to show whether a particular technique was generally known to industry or whether there was any prejudice against a particular technique.

Facts adduced by a party will, however, normally be deemed true, even without supporting evidence, if it is clear that no doubts exist concerning them, if they do not contradict one another or if no objection is raised. In such cases the facts need not be supported by evidence.

There will however be occasions, particularly in opposition proceedings, in which the arguments of the party or parties must be supported by evidence. This will for example be the case where reference is made to prior art, for instance in the form of an oral description, a use or perhaps a company publication and there is some doubt as to whether, and if so when, such prior art was made available to the public.

The means of evidence which are admissible in proceedings before the EPO are (non-exhaustively) listed in Art. 117(1):

– production of documents;

– hearing the parties;

– hearing witnesses;

– sworn statements in writing;

– requests for information, for instance from a publisher concerning the date of publication of a book

– opinions by experts (see E‑IV, 1.8.1); and

– inspection.

The most appropriate way of obtaining evidence in the individual case depends on the facts which have to be proven and on the availability of the evidence. To prove prior use in an opposition, the opponents usually offer as evidence the production of documents, the hearing of witnesses or parties, or they present sworn statements in writing. It is at the opposition division's discretion to evaluate this evidence, there being no fixed rules as to how any category of evidence is to be judged (for the evaluation of evidence, see E‑IV, 4).

If the documents produced (e.g. patent documents) leave no doubt as to their contents and date of availability to the public and are more relevant for the patent in suit than other evidence offered, reasons of procedural efficiency may lead the opposition division to not pursue the other evidence at first.

If the testimony of a witness is offered, the opposition division may decide to hear this person in order to verify the facts for which this witness is brought forward, e.g. the prior use of the claimed product in an undertaking or the existence of an obligation to secrecy. For adequate substantiation the notice of opposition must make clear these facts, as witnesses are meant to serve for corroboration of facts brought forward, not for supplying these facts in place of the opponent. The above applies likewise to hearing the parties (see also E‑IV, 1.6).

The "sworn statements in writing" referred to in Art. 117(1)(g) are unknown in some national legal systems, which instead have their own instruments (see T 558/95).

Whether a written statement ("affidavit") is made under oath or not is only one of the criteria applied by the opposition division in its evaluation of the evidence adduced. Apart from its relevance for the case, other criteria are the relationship between the person making the statement and the parties to the proceedings, the personal interest of that person, the context in which the statement was made, etc. Such a statement does not go beyond its literal content and does not allow the opposition division to assess the associated or background factors. If the alleged facts are contested by the other party, the opposition division does not generally base its decision on such a statement, but summons the person making the statement as a witness, if so offered by the party. The ensuing hearing of the witness allows the opposition division and the parties to put questions to the witness and thus enables the opposition division to establish the facts on the basis of that person's testimony. If that person is not offered as a witness, the opposition division will not pursue this evidence further.

Inspection will enable direct observations to be made and direct impressions to be formed of the object or process concerned. It may, for example, involve the demonstration of a product or process requested by the applicant or proprietor of the patent to substantiate the method of operation of the subject-matter of the patent where this is disputed by the examining or opposition division.

Evidence in the form of documents normally stays on the file. Only exceptionally and on reasoned request can documents filed as evidence be returned unconsidered, e.g. if they were third-party statements filed in breach of a confidentiality agreement and the other parties agree to the request (see T 760/89).

Art. 117(1)1.3 Taking of evidence

The department responsible for the taking of evidence in the form of a hearing of witnesses, parties and experts will, in substantive examination and opposition proceedings, be the division before which the taking of evidence as part of oral proceedings would normally take place. If evidence is to be taken, the examining or opposition division will normally have been enlarged to include a legally qualified member. The division may commission one of its members to examine the evidence adduced. Generally, this will be the primary examiner under Art. 18(2) or Art. 19(2). A member may, for example, be commissioned pursuant to Rule 119(1), for the purposes of an inspection, such as in the form of a demonstration of a process or the investigation of an object, particularly in undertakings located far away.

A member may also be commissioned to attend a court hearing pursuant to Rule 120(3), and put questions to the witnesses, parties and experts.

The language for taking evidence and writing the minutes is governed by Art. 14(3) (language of the proceedings) and Rule 4 (derogations from the provisions concerning the language of the proceedings in oral proceedings); see also E‑III, 10.2 and E‑V.

Evidence can be taken on the premises of the EPO or by videoconference. For details regarding the taking of evidence by videoconference see OJ EPO 2020, A135.

Art. 117(2) Rules 118 to Rule 1201.4 Order to take evidence

Where the competent department of the EPO considers it necessary to hear the oral evidence of parties, witnesses or experts or to carry out an inspection, it must make a decision to this end (order to take evidence), setting out the investigation which it intends to carry out, relevant facts to be proved, the date, time and place of the investigation and whether it will be conducted by videoconference. If oral evidence of witnesses and experts is requested by a party but the witnesses and experts are not simultaneously named, the party is requested, either prior to the issue of the order to take evidence or in the order itself, to make known within a specified time limit the names and addresses of the witnesses and experts whom it wishes to be heard. The time limit to be computed in accordance with Rule 132(2) will be not less than two months and not more than four months, since any party concerned will normally know beforehand whom they wish to be heard as a witness or expert.

Rule 117

The order to take evidence must be notified to the parties. It may be appealed only together with the final decision unless it allows separate appeal (see E‑X, 3).

Art. 1191.5 Summoning of parties, witnesses and experts

The parties, witnesses and experts to be heard must be invited to appear to give evidence on the date fixed. The summons must be notified. At least two months' notice of a summons issued to a party, witness or expert to give evidence must be given unless they agree to a shorter period. The summons must contain:

Art. 119

Rule 118(1) and Rule 118(2)

(i)an extract from the order to take evidence, indicating in particular the date, time and place of the investigation ordered, whether it will be conducted by videoconference and stating the facts regarding which parties, witnesses and experts are to be heard;

Rule 118(2)(a)

(ii)the names of the parties to the proceedings and particulars of the rights which the witnesses or experts may invoke (see E‑IV, 1.10);

Rule 118(2)(b)

(iii)an indication that a party, witness or expert who has been summoned to appear before the European Patent Office on its premises may, at their request, be heard by videoconference; and

Rule 118(2)(c)

(iv)an indication that any party, witness or expert may request to be heard by the competent court of their country of residence and a requirement that they inform the EPO within a time limit to be fixed by the EPO whether they are prepared to appear before it (see E‑IV, 3.2.2 (iii) and E‑IV, 3.2.2 (iv)).

Rule 118(2)(d)

Even if evidence is not taken in oral proceedings, all parties to the proceedings may attend an investigation. Parties not summoned are informed thereof within the period laid down in Rule 118(2), together with a statement that they may attend.

Rule 119(3)1.6 Hearing of parties, witnesses and experts

1.6.1 General remarks

1.6.2 Witnesses and experts not summoned

1.6.3 Guidance to persons heard

1.6.4 Separate hearings

1.6.5 Examination as to personal particulars

1.6.6 Examination as to res gestae

1.6.7 Entitlement of parties to put questions at hearings

1.6.8 Hearing of a witness no longer necessary1.6.1 General remarks

Where the examining or opposition division holds hearings for the purpose of taking evidence (see E‑IV, 1.3) or if the case in question is expected to give rise to particular legal issues, it is advisable that the division be enlarged by the addition of a legally qualified examiner, if this is not already the case (see D‑II, 2.2).

The evidence of witnesses is normally taken at oral proceedings either on the premises of the EPO or by videoconference. A party, witness or expert can even be heard by videoconference if the oral proceedings are otherwise conducted on the premises of the EPO. For details see OJ EPO 2020, A135.

The hearing will be either public or non-public, depending on the oral proceedings themselves (Art. 116(3) and Art. 116(4)).

Where a hearing is held in connection with oral proceedings, the considerations set out in E‑III, 8.2, E‑III, 8.3, E‑III, 8.9 and E‑III, 8.10 are directly applicable, and where this is not the case they apply mutatis mutandis.

The hearing of an "expert" in the sense of Rule 117 requires as a precondition a decision to take evidence (see E‑IV, 1.4). This is different from hearing oral submissions by a person accompanying the representative during oral proceedings, which can be allowed at the discretion of the division (see G 4/95 and E‑III, 8.5).1.6.2 Witnesses and experts not summoned

After opening the proceedings for the taking of evidence, the official in charge of the taking of evidence, i.e. in substantive examination and opposition proceedings the chair of the division concerned or the member commissioned for the taking of evidence, will determine whether any party requests that any other person present but not summoned is heard. If any party makes such a request they must briefly state why and to what purpose the person concerned should give testimony. The department in question will then decide on whether or not to grant the request (for the admission of facts or evidence not filed in due time see E‑VI, 2).1.6.3 Guidance to persons heard

Before any party, witness or expert may be heard, they must be informed that the EPO may request the competent court in the country of residence of the person concerned to re-examine their evidence on oath or in an equally binding form.

Rule 119(2)1.6.4 Separate hearings

Normally each witness must be heard separately, i.e. any other witnesses to be heard subsequently must not be present. This Rule does not apply to experts and to the parties. Witnesses whose statements conflict may be confronted with one another, i.e. each heard in turn in the presence of the other. The same applies to experts.1.6.5 Examination as to personal particulars

The hearing will begin by the persons giving evidence being asked their given names, family name, age, occupation and address. Witnesses and experts must also be asked whether they are related by blood or marriage with any of the parties and whether they have a material interest in a particular party being successful in the proceedings.1.6.6 Examination as to res gestae

The examination as to personal particulars will be followed by the examination as to res gestae. Any person testifying is to be instructed to give a full and logical account of what they know concerning the subject-matter of the hearing. Further questions may have to be put to clarify and supplement statements and to establish on what the knowledge of the person testifying is based. Such questions may be put by the member commissioned for the taking of evidence, where applicable, the chair or any other member of the department concerned. As regards the entitlement of other members of the division to put questions, see E‑III, 8.10. When formulating questions the same considerations apply as for the parties (see E‑IV, 1.6.7).1.6.7 Entitlement of parties to put questions at hearings

The parties may put relevant questions to the testifying parties, witnesses and experts including, e.g. in opposition proceedings, witnesses and experts testifying on behalf of other parties. The official in charge of the taking of evidence will determine at what point in the proceedings such questions may be put.

Any doubts on the part of the competent department, e.g. the opposition division, or a party as to the admissibility of a question must be settled by the competent department. "Leading questions", i.e. questions which already contain the statement which one would like to hear from the witness, practically only requiring him to answer by "yes" or "no", must be avoided, because they do not allow to properly establish the witness' own recollection of the facts. Questions may further not be directed to facts which require no further discussion, which are in no way relevant to the subject-matter for which the taking of evidence has been ordered, or if they aim at establishing facts in respect of which no evidence has been offered. A decision to reject a question cannot be challenged. As regards the entitlement of other members of the division to put questions, see E‑III, 8.10.

Rule 119(3)1.6.8 Hearing of a witness no longer necessary

The testimony of a witness summoned to oral proceedings is heard if the facts which the testimony is supposed to corroborate are relevant to the decision (see E‑IV, 1.2). Therefore, the witness is not heard if the facts to be proved are no longer relevant due to developments before or during oral proceedings before the witness is heard. This may be the case for example if the public availability of the relevant prior art has been proven by another means of evidence or if the patent is to be revoked on another ground for opposition and the patent proprietor submits no admissible auxiliary requests for the assessment of which the testimony would be relevant.1.7 Minutes of taking of evidence

Minutes of the taking of evidence must be drawn up as described in E‑III, 10, subject to the following qualifications:

The minutes of the taking of evidence must, in addition to the essentials of the taking of evidence, also record as comprehensively as possible (almost verbatim as far as the essential points are concerned) the testimony of the parties, witnesses or experts.

Rule 124(1)

The minutes will normally be taken down by a member of the competent department carrying out the taking of evidence. The most efficient way of noting testimony is by way of dictation on to a dictating machine, in the process of which the person hearing the evidence will summarise the testimony in small sections, taking into account any objections raised by the persons being heard, and dictate it in this form on to a dictating machine. If the dictated passage does not correspond in full to their testimony, the persons being heard must raise any objections immediately. This is pointed out to them at the beginning of their testimony. At the end of their testimony, they will be asked to approve the dictated minutes, which they will have listened to as they were dictated. Their approval or any objections are to be included in the dictated text. The dictated minutes are typed out and the parties are provided with a copy as soon as possible. It is not necessary to play back the minutes or to obtain approval of them if the testimony has been recorded verbatim and directly, using technical means.

Where the taking of evidence includes an inspection, the minutes must record, in addition to the essentials of the proceedings, the results of the inspection.

In addition, the taking of evidence as well as oral proceedings (see E‑III, 10.1) may be recorded on sound recording apparatus.

Rule 124(2)1.8 Commissioning of experts

1.8.1 Decision on the form of the opinion

1.8.2 Objection to an expert

1.8.3 Terms of reference of the expert1.8.1 Decision on the form of the opinion

If the competent department decides of its own motion to obtain an expert opinion (D‑VI, 1, sixth paragraph), it will have to decide in what form it is submitted by the expert whom it appoints. The opinion is drawn up in written form only in cases where the competent department considers that this form is adequate in view of the content of the opinion and provided that the parties agree to this arrangement. As a rule, in addition to submitting a written opinion and introducing it orally, the expert will also be heard (see E‑IV, 1.6).

Rule 121(1)

A copy of the opinion must be submitted to the parties. The copy will be produced by the EPO.

Rule 121(3)1.8.2 Objection to an expert

The parties may object to an expert. Therefore, before commissioning an expert to make an opinion, the competent department informs the parties of the expert whom it intends to ask to draw up an opinion and of the subject-matter of the opinion. The communication to the parties states a time limit within which objections to the expert may be made. If the parties do object to an expert, the competent department will decide on the objection.

Rule 121(4)1.8.3 Terms of reference of the expert

The terms of reference of any expert must include: a precise description of their task, the period laid down for the submission of their opinion, the names of the parties to the proceedings and particulars of the rights which they may invoke under the provisions of Rule 122(2) to Rule 122(4) (regarding travel and subsistence expenses and fees, see E‑IV, 1.10).

Rule 121(2)(a)- Rule 121(2)(d)1.9 Costs arising from oral proceedings or taking of evidence

As a rule, the parties to proceedings before the EPO meet the costs they have incurred. This principle notwithstanding, the competent body in the opposition proceedings may for reasons of equity (see D‑IX, 1.4) decide to apportion in some other way the costs arising for the parties in respect of oral proceedings or taking of evidence (see D‑IX, 1) and the costs arising for the EPO in respect of witnesses and experts (see E‑IV, 1.10). The competent body may make the taking of evidence conditional upon deposit with the EPO by the party who requested the evidence to be taken of a sum the amount of which is to be fixed by reference to an estimate of the costs. This procedure is applied where at the request of a party to grant or opposition proceedings evidence is to be taken by hearing witnesses or seeking an expert opinion unless no costs will arise because the witnesses or experts have waived their right to indemnification. If the party requesting evidence to be taken does not comply with the requirement of making such a deposit, the evidence need not be taken. In opposition proceedings the party requesting the evidence bears the costs of indemnifying witnesses or experts unless for reasons of equity in individual cases other arrangements are made for the apportionment of costs under Art. 104(1) in conjunction with Rule 88. Any shortfall between the deposit lodged and the amounts payable by the EPO under Rule 122(4), second sentence, is fixed by the EPO of its own motion. Any unused amount of the deposit lodged is refunded. The EPO's internal costs arising through oral proceedings or taking of evidence, e.g. any associated staff travel and subsistence costs, are to be met by the EPO itself.

Art. 104(1) and Art. 104(2) Rule 122(1) and Rule 122(2)1.10 Entitlements of witnesses and experts

1.10.1 Expenses for travel and subsistence

1.10.2 Loss of earnings, fees

1.10.3 Details of the entitlements of witnesses and experts1.10.1 Expenses for travel and subsistence

Witnesses and experts who are summoned by and appear before the EPO are entitled to appropriate reimbursement, by the EPO, of expenses for travel and subsistence (see E‑IV, 1.10.3). This applies equally to witnesses and experts who are summoned by and appear before the EPO in the course of oral proceedings held by videoconference for travel to the place where they make themselves available to appear before the EPO by videoconference (e.g. a videoconference facility provided by one of the parties or a venue with a sufficiently stable internet connection).

This applies even if the witnesses or experts are not heard, e.g. where evidence is to be produced concerning an alleged prior use and shortly before the taking of evidence such prior use is substantiated by a document already published. Witnesses and experts may be granted an advance on their expenses for travel and subsistence. Witnesses and experts who appear before the EPO without being summoned by it but are heard as witnesses or experts will also be entitled to appropriate reimbursement of expenses for travel and subsistence.

Rule 122(2)1.10.2 Loss of earnings, fees

Witnesses entitled to reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses are also entitled to appropriate compensation, by the EPO, for loss of earnings, and experts to fees from the EPO for their work (see E‑IV, 1.10.3). These payments must be made to the witnesses and experts after they have fulfilled their duties or tasks.

Rule 122(3)1.10.3 Details of the entitlements of witnesses and experts

For the details governing the entitlements of witnesses and experts set out under E‑IV, 1.10.1 and E‑IV, 1.10.2, see OJ EPO 1983, 100. Payment of amounts due must be made by the EPO.

Rule 122(4)1.11 Models

1.11.1 When may models be submitted?

1.11.2 Procedure

1.11.3 Keeping the model1.11.1 When may models be submitted?

The EPC makes no express provision for the submission of models, but there is nothing to stop a party from submitting one himself. Models are not part of the application or patent, and therefore cannot be used to disclose the invention (Art. 83).

Models may be useful in EPO proceedings if they serve to substantiate the patentability of an invention, e.g. by showing that a given device actually works or does so particularly advantageously. Models may also be filed, e.g. in opposition proceedings, to illustrate the state of the art, especially prior use under Art. 54(2). Models as items for inspection therefore constitute evidence under Art. 117(1)(f).1.11.2 Procedure

It is for the competent division to decide whether to take evidence by way of inspection of a model. If it considers this to be necessary, it must take a decision in the form of an order to take evidence (see E‑IV, 1.4), setting out the relevant facts to be proved as well as the date, time and place of the inspection.

Where possible, the inspection is to be carried out on the premises of the EPO. However, if in view of the characteristics of the model (e.g. form, size, material) or due to security constraints an inspection cannot be carried out on EPO premises (see also the notice from the EPO dated 20 December 2016, OJ EPO 2017, A6), the model may be inspected at a different location. In particular if such undertakings are located far away, the division may commission one of its members to carry out the inspection on its behalf (see E‑IV, 1.3).

In general, any object which can be made available for inspection on the premises of the EPO can also be inspected during oral proceedings by videoconference unless such inspection would result in a disadvantage for a party where, e.g. the haptic feel, texture or handling experience of the object is of relevance.

In accordance with Rule 124(1), minutes must be taken, including the essential aspects and the result of the inspection.1.11.3 Keeping the model

Even if the division does inspect the model, the EPO is not obliged to keep it. It is for the division to decide whether a model is to be kept by the EPO. However, as a general rule, models which would require special precautions or security measures if kept in the EPO are returned to the party.

The formalities officer is responsible for implementing the decision to keep or return the model. If the model is to be kept, the formalities officer notes this on a label on the file. If it is to be returned, the formalities officer informs the submitter that the model should be preserved in view of possible opposition or appeal proceedings and notes the date of return on the label.1.12 Video recordings

A party to the proceedings may request that a video recording be shown at the oral proceedings. Such a request must include the recording as such as well as specifying the type of equipment needed.

If video recordings are submitted, the division decides whether showing them will assist the proceedings. Video data carriers are always kept if the division has looked at them.2. Conservation of evidence

2.1 Requirements

2.2 Request for the conservation of evidence

2.3 Competence

2.4 Decision on the request and the taking of evidence2.1 Requirements

On request, the EPO may, without delay, hear oral evidence or conduct inspections, with a view to conserving evidence of facts liable to affect a decision, where there is reason to fear that it might subsequently become more difficult or even impossible to take evidence. This could for example be the case where an important witness is about to emigrate to a distant country or where perishable matter, e.g. a food-stuff, is adduced as involving a use made accessible to the public.

Rule 123(1)2.2 Request for the conservation of evidence

The request for the conservation of evidence must contain:

Rule 123(2)

(i)the name, address and nationality of the persons filing the request and the state in which their residence or principal place of business is located, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 41(2)(c);

Rule 123(2)(a)

(ii)sufficient identification of the European patent application or European patent in question;

Rule 123(2)(b)

(iii)the designation of the facts in respect of which evidence is to be taken;

Rule 123(2)(c)

(iv)particulars of the way in which evidence is to be taken; and

Rule 123(2)(d)

(v)a statement establishing a prima facie case for fearing that it might subsequently become more difficult or impossible to take evidence.

Rule 123(2)(e)

The request is not deemed to have been filed until the fee for conservation of evidence has been paid.

Rule 123(3)2.3 Competence

The decision on the request and any resulting taking of evidence are incumbent upon the department of the EPO required to take the decision liable to be affected by the facts to be established.

Responsibility for the decision and the taking of evidence will therefore normally rest with:

(i)the examining division, from the date of filing until the date of the decision on the granting of the patent;

(ii)the opposition division, from the latter date until expiry of the time allowed for filing notice of opposition and during opposition proceedings; and

(iii)the board of appeal, from the date of a final decision by the opposition division until it becomes legally binding or while appeal proceedings are pending.

Rule 123(4)2.4 Decision on the request and the taking of evidence

The competent department must decide upon the request without delay. If it grants the request, it must also immediately make a decision on the taking of evidence.

Rule 123(1) Rule 117

The provisions with regard to the taking of evidence in proceedings before the EPO are applicable.

Rule 123(4)

The date on which the measures are to be taken must therefore be communicated to the applicant for or proprietor of the patent and the other parties in sufficient time to allow them to attend. They may ask relevant questions.

3.6 Taking of evidence by an appointed person3.1 Legal co-operation

Upon receipt of letters rogatory from the EPO, the courts or other competent authorities of contracting states will undertake, on behalf of the EPO and within the limits of their jurisdiction, any necessary enquiries.

Art. 131(2)3.2 Means of giving or taking evidence

3.2.1 Taking of evidence on oath

3.2.2 Evidence taken by a competent court3.2.1 Taking of evidence on oath

The principal case where evidence is taken by a competent court will be the hearing of parties, witnesses or experts. In such instances the competent department may request the competent court to take the evidence on oath or in an equally binding form.

Rule 120(3)3.2.2 Evidence taken by a competent court

The competent department will, if necessary, request a competent court to take evidence, where appropriate under oath, where:

(i)the taking of evidence by that department would entail disproportionately high travelling costs or the taking of evidence by the competent court appears to be appropriate on other grounds;

Rule 120(3)

(ii)the competent department considers it advisable for the evidence of a party, witness or expert it has heard to be re-examined under oath or in an equally binding form (see E‑IV, 3.2.1);

Rule 120(2)

(iii)there has been no reply to the summons by the expiry of a period fixed by the competent department in the summons (see E‑IV, 1.5(iii)); or

Rule 120(1)

(iv)any party, witness or expert who has been summoned before that department requests the latter in accordance with E‑IV, 1.5(iii) to allow their evidence to be heard by a competent court in their country of residence. If the party, witness or expert simply refuses to be heard by the responsible division, they are notified that the competent national court will have the relevant national legal possibilities to oblige them to appear and to testify.

Rule 120(1) Rule 150(3)3.3 Letters rogatory

The EPO must draw up letters rogatory in the language of the competent authority or must attach to such letters rogatory a translation into the language of that authority.

Rule 150(2)

Letters rogatory must be addressed to the central authority designated by the contracting state.

Rule 150(1)3.4 Procedures before the competent authority

The EPO must be informed of the time when, and the place where, the enquiry is to take place and must inform the parties, witnesses and experts concerned.

Rule 150(5)

If so requested by the EPO, the competent authority shall permit the attendance of members of the department concerned and allow them to question any person giving evidence either directly or through the competent authority. Whether the parties may put questions or not will depend on the laws of the contracting states concerned.

Rule 120(3) Rule 150(6)3.5 Costs of taking evidence

The execution of letters rogatory does not give rise to any reimbursement of fees or costs of any nature. Nevertheless, the state in which letters rogatory are executed has the right to require the European Patent Organisation to reimburse any fees paid to experts and interpreters and the costs incurred as a result of the attendance of members of the competent department when evidence is taken.

Rule 150(7)3.6 Taking of evidence by an appointed person

If the law applied by the competent authority obliges the parties to secure evidence and the authority is not able itself to execute the letters rogatory, that authority may, with the consent of the competent department, appoint a suitable person to do so. When seeking the consent of the department concerned, the competent authority must indicate the approximate costs which would result from this procedure. If the competent department gives its consent, the European Patent Organisation must reimburse any costs incurred; without such consent, the Organisation is not liable for such costs.

4.1 General remarks

4.3 Examination of evidence

4.4 Asking for evidence

4.5 Evaluation of the testimony of a witness

4.6 Evaluation of the testimony of parties

4.7 Evaluation of an expert opinion

4.8 Evaluation of an inspection4.1 General remarks

The competent department has the power and the duty to assess whether the alleged facts are sufficiently established based on evidence. The proceedings under the EPC are governed by the principle of free evaluation of evidence. This principle allows, and requires, a competent department to decide according to its own discretion and conviction, by taking into account the entire content of the parties' submissions. There are no firm rules according to which certain types of evidence are, or are not, convincing. This does not mean that the evaluation of evidence may be arbitrary, rather the evidence must be assessed comprehensively and dutifully. The only decisive factor is whether the department is convinced of the truth of the factual allegation, i.e. how credible the department classifies a piece of evidence. To do this, the department must put all the arguments for and against a factual statement in relation to the required standard of proof. In doing so, the department remains bound by the laws of the logic and by probability based on experience. The department sets out in the decision the reasons for reaching its conclusions (G 2/21).

The principle of free evaluation of evidence may not be used to simply disregard an admissibly submitted piece of evidence that is relied upon by a party in support of an inference that is challenged and is decisive for the final decision, for example to prove the presence of a technical effect. Disregarding it as a matter of principle would deprive the party of a basic legal procedural right enshrined in Art. 113(1) and Art. 117(1). For example, the mere fact that evidence is post-published is not a sufficient reason not to take it into account.

The competent department must examine whether the conclusions drawn by the parties from the evidence and facts are correct and give grounds for the conclusions it itself freely arrives at on the basis of the situation as a whole.

The state of the art to be taken into consideration in individual cases for the purposes of Art. 54 is that laid down in G‑IV, 1 to G-IV, 5 and G-IV, 7 and G‑V.

The competent department is not obliged to take into consideration any facts or evidence not presented by the parties in due time, except within the limits specified in E‑VI, 2.4.2 Types of evidence

When evaluating submissions made, the difference between facts, evidence and arguments must be observed.

Example:

The opponent asserts that the preamble to claim 1 is described in document A, the characterising portion in document B (facts). To prove this, documents are submitted (evidence). The opponent then contends that the method claimed does not involve an inventive step, because the skilled person, on the basis of common general knowledge, would have combined the submitted documents in such a way as to arrive at the subject-matter of claim 1 (argument).

Evidence admissible in EPO proceedings is not confined to that listed in Art. 117(1). "Taking of evidence" within the meaning of Art. 117 comprises the submission or gathering of evidence of any kind, particularly the filing of documents.

Pure arguments are not evidence (see T 642/92).4.3 Examination of evidence

When evidence is submitted, the first thing to establish is what fact is being asserted, and then whether that fact is relevant to the decision. If not, the assertion is no longer considered and the evidence is not examined further. If the alleged fact is relevant, the next point is whether it is proven by the evidence submitted.

When evidence is examined, since the EPC says nothing about how the outcome of taking of evidence must be assessed, the principle of unfettered consideration applies. This means that its content and its significance for the proceedings are assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of each individual case (e.g. time, place, type of evidence, position of witness in firm, etc.). The principle of unfettered consideration also means that EPO departments are empowered to evaluate evidence submitted by the parties in any appropriate manner, or indeed to disregard it as unimportant or irrelevant. In particular it has to be decided on a case-by-case basis when a particular piece of evidence is sufficient.

When deciding whether an alleged fact is accepted, the division may use the criterion of the "balance of probabilities", which means that it is satisfied that one set of facts is more likely to be true than the other. Furthermore, the more serious the issue, the more convincing must be the evidence to support it (see T 750/94). For example, if a decision might result in revocation of the patent in a case concerning alleged prior use, the available evidence has to be very critically and strictly examined. In particular, in the case of alleged prior use for which little if any evidence would be available to the patentee to establish that no prior use had taken place, the division has to cede to the stricter criterion close to absolute conviction, i.e. beyond any reasonable doubt (see T 97/94).

When parties make conflicting assertions, the division must decide which evidence is the most convincing. If it cannot establish which allegation is right on the basis of the evidence put forward, it must decide on the basis of the burden of proof, i.e. against the party bearing that burden but unable to prove its point convincingly.4.4 Asking for evidence

When pointing out that it cannot accept a line of argument because certain facts have not been proven, the division must do so as neutrally and objectively as possible. In particular, it may neither

(a)require a specific kind of evidence (see T 474/04), nor

(b)prescribe the content of the evidence (e.g. the wording of a sworn statement in writing (see T 804/92).

The taking of evidence in each of the forms listed in Art. 117 is done at the discretion of the EPO department in question, i.e. only if that department considers it necessary. This will be the case, for example, if a fact relevant to the decision needs to be proven.4.5 Evaluation of the testimony of a witness

After the witnesses have been heard, the party or parties must be given an opportunity of making observations. The observations may be made either in oral proceedings following the taking of evidence or exceptionally in writing after transmission of the minutes of the taking of evidence. The decision on this matter will rest with the competent department. The parties may file requests accordingly.

Only when this has been done may the competent department proceed to evaluate the evidence. Where a witness's testimony which is crucial to the decision has been challenged by a party but the department regards it as credible, or where a witness's oral or written testimony is disregarded in its decision as being not credible, the department concerned must state the grounds for its view in its decision.

In evaluating a witness's oral or written testimony, special attention is to be paid to the following:

(i)what is important is what witnesses can relate concerning the points at issue on the basis of their own knowledge or views, and whether they have practical experience in the field in question. Second-hand assertions based on something heard from third parties are for the most part worthless on their own. It is also important from the point of view of the evaluation whether the witness was involved in the event himself or only knows of it as an observer or listener;

(ii)in the event of long intervals of time (several years) between the event in question and the testimony, it is to be borne in mind that most people's power of recall is limited without the support of documentary evidence;

(iii)where testimony appears to conflict, the texts of the statements concerned are closely compared with one another.

Apparent contradiction in the testimony of witnesses may sometimes be resolved in this way. For example, a close examination of apparently contradictory statements by witnesses as to whether a substance X was commonly used for a particular purpose may show that there is in fact no contradiction at all, in that while one witness was saying specifically that substance X was not used for that particular purpose, the other witness was saying no more than that substances like X, or a certain class of substances to which X belonged, were commonly used for this particular purpose without intending to make any statement regarding substance X itself;

(iv)an employee of a party to the proceedings can be heard as a witness (see T 482/89). The possible partiality of a witness determines how the evidence is assessed, not whether it is admissible (see T 443/93).4.6 Evaluation of the testimony of parties

Oral or written evidence given by parties or their refusal to give evidence are evaluated in the light of their special interest in the matter. Because of their special interest, the testimony of parties possibly should not be evaluated on the same level as that of neutral witnesses. This applies above all where parties have been present when witnesses have been heard and have ascertained the attitude of the competent department. The considerations set out in E‑IV, 4.5 (Evaluation of the testimony of a witness) apply mutatis mutandis.4.7 Evaluation of an expert opinion

The competent department must examine whether the grounds on which an expert opinion is based are convincing. Notwithstanding its discretion in the evaluation of evidence, it may not disregard an expert opinion in the absence of grounds based on adequate specialist knowledge of its own or of another expert, irrespective of whether the latter expert is an independent expert commissioned under Rule 121 or an expert who testifies at the request of one of the parties.4.8 Evaluation of an inspection

In the case of a demonstration, a specific test programme under specific conditions is agreed in advance. During the demonstration itself care must be taken to ensure that the characteristics or conditions of operation claimed for the invention are complied with. Where an invention is compared under test with an item forming part of the state of the art, as far as possible the same or comparable test conditions must be applied to both.Chapter V – Derogations from the language of the proceedings in oral proceedings

1. Use of an official language

2. Language of a contracting state or other language

3. Exceptions from sections 1 and 2

4. Language used in the taking of evidence

5. Language used by employees of the EPO

6. Language used in the minutes1. Use of an official language

Any party to oral proceedings before the EPO may, in lieu of the language of the proceedings, use one of the other official languages of the EPO, on condition that such party either gives notice to the EPO at least one month before the date laid down for such oral proceedings or makes provision for interpreting into the language of the proceedings. In the former case, it is the responsibility of the EPO to provide for interpretation at its own expense.

A party must be clear as to which official language it wishes to use. It then has a right to both speak and hear that language, as long as the conditions of Rule 4 have been fulfilled. The party does not, however, have a right to have one language in which it will speak and a different language in which it will hear (see T 774/05).

The language of the proceedings as defined in Art. 14(3) cannot be changed. This means that any amendments to the application or patent have to be filed in the language of the proceedings (Rule 3(2)).

If all parties have indicated that they will use another official language, the division may depart from the language of the proceedings so as to manage without or with fewer interpreters (this question normally arises only in opposition proceedings). The parties' summonses are therefore accompanied by information which encourages them to agree how this can be achieved.

It may be possible to agree to limit the interpreting to "one-way", i.e. from one language into another but not the other way round. If a comment made in one language has clearly been misunderstood, the division may clarify it in another. Under no circumstances however can its members officially act as interpreters.

Rule 4(1) and Rule 4(5)2. Language of a contracting state or other language

Any party may likewise use one of the official languages of the contracting states, other than English, French or German, on condition that they make provision for interpreting into the language of the proceedings. However, if the parties and the EPO agree, any language may be used in oral proceedings without interpreting or prior notice.

Rule 4(1) and Rule 4(4)3. Exceptions from sections 1 and 2

Derogations from the provisions of Rule 4(1) are permitted, and these are at the discretion of the EPO. Clearly such permission must depend on the circumstances of the individual case. It may, for example, be envisaged that parties are unable to give one month's notice through no fault of their own, and, although they have made arrangements for an interpreter, the latter is unable (e.g. through illness) to attend. If, in such circumstances, the EPO is unable to provide for interpreting, it postpones the oral proceedings if they occur at the examination stage. However, in opposition proceedings, the oral proceedings continue if the parties agree and the employees of the EPO involved in the proceedings can cope with the language. In other cases, the EPO postpones the oral proceedings and any costs incurred by the innocent party as a result of the postponement are a matter for apportionment under Art. 104.

Rule 4(1)4. Language used in the taking of evidence

When the evidence is being taken, a party, witness or expert who is unable to express himself adequately in English, French or German or in any other official language of the contracting states is permitted to use another language. The EPO is responsible for interpreting into the language of the proceedings, assuming that this is necessary, if the evidence is taken at the request of the EPO itself. However, if the taking of evidence follows a request by a party to the proceedings, the use of a language other than English, French or German is allowed only if that party provides for interpreting into the language of the proceedings or, at the discretion of the EPO, into any one of English, French or German. This discretion is exercised in opposition proceedings only if the other parties agree.

Rule 4(3)5. Language used by employees of the EPO

Employees of the EPO may use in oral proceedings an official language of the EPO other than the language of proceedings. The parties must be informed accordingly prior to the oral proceedings unless it can be reasonably assumed that they would not object to this, e.g. because they have equally requested to use that different official language.

However, employees may not depart from the language of the proceedings without good reason. Unless the parties are competent in the language used, the EPO provides for interpreting into the language of the proceedings at its own expense.

Rule 4(2)6. Language used in the minutes

Where the official language actually employed in oral proceedings is not the language of the proceedings as defined in Art. 14(3), if the examining or opposition division or the Legal Division considers it appropriate and subject to explicit agreement of all parties concerned, the minutes may be recorded in the official language actually employed in the oral proceedings.

Prior to the agreement of the parties, their attention is drawn to the fact that the EPO will not provide translations of the minutes into the language of the proceedings as defined in Art. 14(3). This condition, as well as the declaration of agreement of the party or parties, is recorded in the minutes.

Statements made in English, French or German are entered in the minutes of the proceedings in the language employed (Rule 4(6)).

Statements made in any other language must be entered in the official language into which they are translated.

Amendments to the text of the description or claims of a European patent application or European patent made during oral proceedings must be entered in the minutes in the language of the proceedings.

If the proceedings are conducted in a language other than English, French or German and no interpretation is effected, statements are entered in the minutes in the language employed and the EPO subsequently provides in the minutes a translation into the language of the proceedings.Chapter VI – Examination by the EPO of its own motion; facts, evidence or grounds not submitted in due time; observations by third parties

1. Examination by the EPO of its own motion

2. Late-filed submissions

3. Observations by third parties

4. External complaints1. Examination by the EPO of its own motion

1.1 General remarks

1.2 Limits on the obligation to undertake examination1.1 General remarks

In proceedings before it, the EPO examines the facts of its own motion; it is not restricted in this examination to the facts, evidence and arguments provided by the parties and the relief sought. This principle of examination by the EPO of its own motion must be complied with by the competent department during all proceedings pending before it. Thus, once proceedings have been initiated, e.g. once a valid request for examination has been filed or an admissible notice of opposition has been filed (although it may subsequently be withdrawn), if there is reason to believe, e.g. from personal knowledge or from observations presented by third parties, that there are facts and evidence not yet considered in the proceedings which in whole or in part prejudice the granting or maintenance of the European patent, such facts and evidence must be included in those examined by the EPO of its own motion pursuant to Art. 114(1). See D‑V, 2 for the extent of substantive examination of the facts and evidence in opposition proceedings.

Art. 114(1)1.2 Limits on the obligation to undertake examination

However, the obligation to undertake such examination must be kept within limits in the interests of procedural expediency. For example, in opposition proceedings, an offer to prove that an alleged public prior use took place will not be taken up if the opponent making such an allegation has ceased to participate in the proceedings and the necessary evidence cannot be easily obtained at a reasonable cost.

The unity of the subject-matter of the European patent is not to be examined in opposition proceedings (G 1/91, see D‑V, 2.2).2. Late-filed submissions

The EPO may disregard facts or evidence (e.g. publications) which are not submitted in due time by the parties concerned.

This also applies to grounds for opposition not submitted in due time, together with supporting facts and evidence in opposition proceedings (see D‑V, 2.2). Note in this respect that according to G 1/95 and G 7/95, Art. 100(a) does not constitute one single ground for opposition, but has to be considered a collection of individual grounds for opposition, i.e. individual legal bases for objection to the maintenance of a patent. This applies not only to distinctly different objections, such as subject-matter which is not patentable (Art. 52(2)) as compared to subject-matter which is not capable of industrial application (Art. 57), but also to an objection for lack of novelty as opposed to an objection for lack of inventive step.

New arguments based on facts, evidence and grounds constituting the legal and factual framework of the opposition cannot be disregarded.

In deciding whether to admit facts, evidence or grounds for opposition not filed in due time, their relevance to the decision, the state of the procedure and the reasons for belated submission are to be considered. If examination of late-filed grounds for opposition, late-filed facts or late-filed evidence reveals without any further investigation (i.e. prima facie) that they are relevant, i.e. that the basis of the envisaged decision would be changed, then the competent department has to take such grounds, facts or evidence into consideration no matter what stage the procedure has reached and whatever the reasons for belated submission. In that case, the principle of examination by the EPO of its own motion under Art. 114(1) takes precedence over the possibility of disregarding facts or evidence under Art. 114(2) (see T 156/84). Note, however, the limits on the obligation to undertake further examinations as set out in E‑VI, 1.2. Otherwise, the department informs the party concerned in the decision, with due regard to Art. 113(1) (see T 281/00), that the facts, evidence and/or grounds for opposition were not submitted in due time and, since they are not relevant to the decision, will be disregarded pursuant to Art. 114(2). On the apportionment of any costs arising from the late filing of facts and evidence, see D‑IX, 1.4.

The latest date up to which submissions can be considered at all is the date on which the decision is handed over to the EPO's internal postal service for transmittal to the parties (see G 12/91).

The above applies in written proceedings; in oral proceedings submissions can only be considered up to the pronouncement of the decision (see E‑III, 9).

Art. 114(2)

2.1 General principles in opposition proceedings

2.2 Submissions filed in preparation for or during oral proceedings2.1 General principles in opposition proceedings

As far as the assessment of late filing in opposition proceedings is concerned, the rulings of the Enlarged Board of Appeal in G 9/91 and G 10/91 apply. According to these decisions, in principle, the opposition is to be examined to the extent and on the grounds submitted during the period for opposition. Under Art. 114(1) the opposition division may go beyond this framework if prima facie maintenance of the patent is prejudiced. The principles developed by the Enlarged Board with respect to new grounds also apply to late-filed facts and evidence (see T 1002/92). Therefore late-filed facts and evidence are to be admitted into the proceedings only if they are prima facie relevant, i.e. if they would change the envisaged decision, see E‑VI, 2.

If a patent proprietor replies to a notice of opposition by amending the patent, such a request for amendment cannot be considered as late-filed and has to be admitted into the proceedings (Rule 79(1)).

Thus, if the proprietor limits the patent to the subject-matter of a dependent claim as granted, new facts and evidence submitted by the opponent in reply to this amendment are as a general rule to be treated as late-filed and only to be admitted under Art. 114(1) if they are prima facie relevant because the opponent must be prepared for this type of amendment and must have provided material during the nine-month opposition period.

If the new facts and submissions are not prima facie relevant, they are to be disregarded under Art. 114(2). An exception to this rule is where the patent specification as granted contained a large number of dependent claims and the opponent could not reasonably have been expected to deal with all of them in the notice of opposition.

If, however, the proprietor amends the patent at an early stage of the proceedings in a manner not foreseeable by the opponent, e.g. by taking up features disclosed in the description, the opponent will have the opportunity to provide new facts and evidence, i.e. possibly even to submit a new ground for opposition and new documents. Such a submission has to be admitted into the proceedings because the subject of the proceedings has changed. At a late stage in the proceedings such unforeseeable amendments are subject to the criterion of "clear allowability" (see H‑II, 2.7.1).2.2 Submissions filed in preparation for or during oral proceedings

If oral proceedings are arranged, the division issues a summons together with an annex drawing attention to the points to be discussed (Rule 116(1)) and normally containing the division's provisional and non-binding opinion (see E‑III, 6 and D‑VI, 3.2).

2.2.1 New facts and evidence

2.2.2 Amendments filed in preparation for or during oral proceedings

2.2.3 Principles relating to the exercise of discretion

2.2.4 Right to be heard

2.2.5 Costs2.2.1 New facts and evidence

Rule 116(1), being an implementation of Art. 114(2) as a further development on the existing jurisprudence regarding facts or evidence not filed in due time, makes it clear that the examining or opposition division has a discretion to disregard new facts or evidence for the reason that they have been filed after the date indicated in the summons under Rule 116 unless they have to be admitted because the subject of the proceedings has changed.

For instance, if the opposition division states in the annex to the summons that the patent is likely to be revoked, and a timely filed request for amendment is admitted but relates to subject-matter not covered by the claims as granted, the subject of the proceedings has changed. Consequently, new facts and evidence submitted by the opponent in response to these requests will be admitted into the proceedings, even if they arrive after the final date set under Rule 116.

However, if the proprietor's requests relate to amendments based only on claims as granted, new facts and evidence submitted by the opponent will be treated as late-filed even if submitted before the final date, i.e. they will be admitted only if they are prima facie relevant unless there are other aspects militating in favour of admitting them, such as a large number of dependent claims in the patent as granted (E‑VI, 2.1).

Similarly, if in the provisional and non-binding opinion the opposition division reaches the conclusion that maintenance of the patent is not prejudiced by the facts and evidence submitted so far by the opponent, this fact per se does not give the opponent the right to have new facts and evidence admitted into the proceedings, even if submitted before the final date fixed under Rule 116(1).

Rule 116(1)2.2.2 Amendments filed in preparation for or during oral proceedings

Rule 116(2) imposes the same obligations on the applicant or patent proprietor when submitting new documents which meet the requirements of the EPC (i.e. new amendments to the description, claims and drawings) as Rule 116(1) imposes on the parties in submitting new facts and evidence.

The examining or opposition division has the discretion to disregard amendments filed after the date set under Rule 116(1) as being late-filed unless they have to be admitted because the subject of the proceedings has changed. Amendments submitted before the date set under Rule 116(1) cannot, as a rule, be considered as being late-filed.

The following are examples of what would normally constitute a change of subject of the proceedings:

– the opposition division admits under Art. 114(1) new facts and evidence or a new ground of opposition because they are prima facie relevant;

– the examining division cites a further relevant document for the first time (H‑II, 2.7);

– the examining or opposition division departs from a previously notified opinion: for example, contrary to its preliminary opinion set out in the annex to the summons, the opposition division concludes during oral proceedings that an objection prejudices the maintenance of the patent.

In these examples, a request from the applicant or proprietor for a corresponding amendment cannot be rejected as being late-filed even if submitted after the date set under Rule 116(1). If, however, after a change of opinion by the division, the applicant or proprietor files a new request that reintroduces subject-matter against which the division has already raised an objection, the division has discretion to disregard the new request due to it being prima facie not allowable.

On receipt of amendments filed after the final date set under Rule 116(1), the division therefore first analyses whether the amendments were filed in due course in response to a change of the subject of the proceedings. Only if this is not the case does the division have the discretion to disregard the amendments. This discretion is to be exercised according to the principles set out in E‑VI, 2.2.3. The mere fact that amendments are filed after a given date is not on its own a legal basis for not admitting them.

Rule 116(2)2.2.3 Principles relating to the exercise of discretion

In exercising its discretion under Art. 114(2) and Rule 116(1) and (2), the division must assess all relevant factors of the case.

The division will in the first place have to consider the relevance of the late-filed facts or evidence (see E‑VI, 2) or the allowability of the late-filed amendments on a prima facie basis. If these facts or evidence are not prima facie relevant, i.e. if they do not appear to affect the outcome of the proceedings (T 320/15), or if these amendments are not clearly allowable (see H‑II, 2.7.1), they will not be admitted.

For instance, if the opposition division states in the annex to the summons that the patent is likely to be revoked and the proprietor in response submits amendments after the final date set under Rule 116(1), possibly not until the oral proceedings, the division could, in principle, treat such requests as late-filed and apply the criterion of "clear allowability" (see H‑II, 2.7.1) in judging whether they can be admitted into the proceedings. However, the division will consider admitting such requests into the proceedings if they relate to the subject-matter of dependent claims as granted.

Convergence of requests is another of the relevant factors that the division may consider when exercising its discretion (for a definition of convergence, see H‑III, 3.3.2.2).

For the purpose of admissibility, a late-filed document's relevance is normally decided relative to the amended claims against which it is cited. Documents that have limited relevance to an initial set of claims may acquire new relevance as a result of subsequent amendments to those claims (T 366/11).

Before admitting these submissions, the division will next consider procedural expediency, the possibility of abuse of the procedure (e.g. one of the parties is obviously protracting the proceedings) and the question whether the parties can reasonably be expected to familiarise themselves in the time available with the new facts or evidence or the proposed amendments.

As regards procedural expediency, where the late-filed facts or evidence are relevant but their introduction would cause a prolonged adjournment of the proceedings, the division may decide not to admit these facts or evidence in the proceedings. An example would be where the witness still has to be found or lengthy tests are still necessary. The division may, however, also postpone the proceedings and in doing so may have to consider the apportionment of costs in opposition proceedings (Art. 104). Similarly, if late-filed requests are based on subject-matter not previously covered by the claims, they will normally not be admitted into the proceedings also for reasons of procedural efficiency. Admission of such requests could give rise to a postponement of oral proceedings and to a decision on apportionment of costs.

Examples of possible abuse of the proceedings would be:

– The patent proprietor introduces at short notice a proliferation of auxiliary requests which are not a reaction to the course of the proceedings.

– The opponent knowingly abstains from raising an assertion of public prior use based on its own activities until late in the proceedings, even though the evidence in its support had become fully available earlier (see T 534/89).

– The applicant or patent proprietor presents a large number of requests or incomplete variants of requests and invites the division to choose, shifting the responsibility for determining the content of the application or patent to the division. It is the duty of any party to proceedings to make its own case and to formulate its own requests (see T 446/00).

Concerning the question of whether the parties can reasonably be expected to familiarise themselves in the time available with the new facts or evidence or the proposed amendments:

– It may only become apparent in the oral proceedings that the pending request submitted to overcome grounds for opposition is not allowable under the EPC. The opponent must always expect to have to discuss subject-matter based on dependent claims as granted if they are reasonable in number.

– The proprietor is in principle free to withdraw previously submitted amendments and defend the patent as granted unless this would constitute an abuse of the proceedings.

Art. 114(2), Rule 116(1) and Rule 116(2)2.2.4 Right to be heard

Generally, the parties must be heard before the division decides on whether or not to admit late-filed submissions.

For instance, if the opponent introduces a new ground for opposition during oral proceedings, they must always be granted the right to be heard. This means that the division must give the parties the opportunity to put forward arguments and duly consider them before deciding on the admissibility of the new ground. Similarly, where the opponent files pertinent new material, the patent proprietor must be given a chance to present comments and submit amendments. If the opposition division approves the introduction of new facts or evidence and if the other parties have not had sufficient time to study them, it grants, where easily comprehensible subject-matter is involved, the parties an opportunity to familiarise themselves with it, possibly by briefly interrupting the oral proceedings. If this is not feasible, the other parties must, upon request, be given the opportunity to comment in the proceedings subsequent to the oral proceedings, where appropriate in a further set of oral proceedings. Where possible, however, oral proceedings will not be adjourned.

Where possible, legal commentaries, decisions (of a board of appeal, for example) and reports on legal decisions which are to be referred to in oral proceedings must be notified to the opposition division and the other parties in good time before the proceedings. They may, however, be quoted or submitted for the first time in the oral proceedings themselves if the opposition division agrees after consulting the parties.

The reasons for the decision on the admissibility of late-filed facts, evidence and requests have to be provided in the written decision and must not come as a surprise. A mere reference to the division's discretionary power is not sufficient (E‑X, 2.10). In examination proceedings, reasons only need to be provided if the late-filed facts, evidence or requests are not admitted.

Art. 113(1)2.2.5 Costs

In opposition, relevant facts and evidence submitted at a late stage of the proceedings, possibly not until the oral proceedings for example, could give rise to a decision on apportionment of costs, see D‑IX, 1.2, if so requested. As regards the costs which may be incurred for late submissions, see also D‑IX, 1.4.3. Observations by third parties

Following publication of the European patent application under Art. 93, any person may present observations concerning the patentability of the invention. Although lack of novelty and/or inventive step are the most common observations, third-party observations may also be directed to clarity (Art. 84), sufficiency of disclosure (Art. 83), patentability (Art. 52(2) and Art. 52(3), Art. 53 or Art. 57) and unallowable amendments (Art. 76(1), Art. 123(2) and Art. 123(3)).

Such observations must be filed in writing in English, French or German and must include a statement of the grounds on which they are based. The person filing them may not be a party to the proceedings before the EPO. The web interface provided by the EPO is the preferred means of filing such observations (see OJ EPO 2017, A86). Observations may be filed anonymously.

Art. 115 Rule 114(1)

Documentary evidence and, in particular, publications submitted in support of the arguments may be filed in any language. However, the EPO may request that a translation into one of its official languages be filed within a period to be specified; otherwise the evidence will be disregarded.

Although third parties are sent acknowledgment of the receipt of their observations (if these were not filed anonymously), the EPO does not specifically inform them of any further action it takes in response to them. However, the outcome of the evaluation by the competent division will briefly be indicated in the respective office action from the EPO (e.g. in a communication or in the intention to grant) and will thus be visible to the public.

Rule 3(3)

The observations, including those filed anonymously, become part of the file. They are communicated without delay to applicants or proprietors, who may comment on them. If they call into question the patentability of the invention in whole or in part, the examining or opposition division will take them into account in the next office action. If the observations relate to alleged prior art available other than from a document, e.g. from use, this is taken into account only if the alleged facts either are not disputed by the applicant or proprietor or are established beyond reasonable doubt.

Observations by third parties received in examination after dispatch of a Rule 71(3) communication but before the decision to grant (EPO Form 2006A) has been handed over to the EPO postal service will be considered by the examining division. If they are relevant, the examining division will resume examination. Otherwise, brief substantive feedback will be provided in the file.

Observations by third parties received after the decision has been pronounced in oral proceedings (e.g. in the case of a refusal or in opposition) or issued in written proceedings and handed over to the EPO postal service (e.g. in the case of a grant decision or if, in opposition, no oral proceedings were held), will be included in the file without taking note of their content.

Observations by third parties received once proceedings are no longer pending will be neither taken into account nor made available for file inspection. They will however be made available for file inspection and considered if the proceedings before the EPO become pending again, e.g. upon the start of any opposition or limitation proceedings.

The EPO will make every effort to issue the next office action within three months of receipt of third-party observations under Art. 115 by the examining division, provided the observations are substantiated and have not been filed anonymously. Where the observations are received at a time when a reply from the applicant to a communication is outstanding, this period starts from receipt of the reply at the EPO.

The EPO will generally apply the practice regarding third-party observations filed in the Euro-direct procedure mutatis mutandis to third-party observations filed during the international phase upon entry of the Euro-PCT application into the European phase.

Where a third-party observation was filed during the international phase, the EPO as designated/elected Office will consider its content upon entry into the European phase once this becomes available to it. The examining division will make every effort to issue the next office action within three months after expiry of the period under Rule 161, but only on condition that the third party has clearly expressed its wish to achieve expedited treatment in the European phase, that the observation was filed non-anonymously and that it was substantiated. A third party wishing to achieve such a result in the European phase must, therefore, make this clear in the observation or file the observation with the EPO as designated/elected Office.

Rule 114(2)4. External complaints

External complaints can concern any service or product delivered by the EPO and can be submitted by any person, including parties to proceedings before the EPO (for enquiries as to the processing of files, see E‑VIII, 7). Complaints can be submitted using the online form available at epo.org/en/formal-complaint.

Complaints are forwarded to a dedicated EPO department responsible for

(i)ensuring that the complaint is dealt with fairly and efficiently and that suitable measures are taken to address it; and

(ii)providing a comprehensive reply to the complaint.

The complaint handling procedure does not replace the procedures laid down by the EPC; nor does the department responsible for handling complaints take decisions on procedural requests. Hence, the relevant department competent for the respective proceedings decides on:

(a)complaints relating to procedural and/or substantive aspects of specific pending proceedings which are submitted by a party to those proceedings. All parties to the proceedings will be informed accordingly.

(b)complaints relating to substantive issues which are submitted by a third party while proceedings are pending before the EPO. Such a submission will be treated as a third-party observation (see E‑VI, 3).

The department responsible for handling complaints promptly forwards any complaint relating to appeal proceedings to the EPO Boards of Appeal Unit.

Complaints having a substantive and/or procedural bearing on proceedings before the EPO, as well as replies thereto by the department responsible for handling complaints, will only exceptionally be excluded from file inspection (see D‑II, 4.3; decision of the President of the EPO concerning documents excluded from file inspection, OJ EPO 2007, Special edition No. 3, J.3).

1.1 Cases in which the proceedings may be interrupted

1.2 Responsible department

1.3 Date of interruption

1.4 Resumption of proceedings

1.5 Resumption of time limits1.1 Cases in which the proceedings may be interrupted

Pursuant to Rule 142(1), proceedings before the EPO are interrupted in one of the following events:

Rule 142(1)

(i)in the event of the death or legal incapacity of the applicant for or proprietor of a European patent or of the person authorised by national law to act on their behalf. To the extent that the above events do not affect the authorisation of a representative appointed under Art. 134, proceedings will be interrupted only on application by such representative;

Rule 142(1)(a)

(ii)in the event of the applicant for or proprietor of a European patent, as a result of some action taken against their property, being prevented by legal reasons from continuing the proceedings before the EPO; or

Rule 142(1)(b)

(iii)in the event of the death or legal incapacity of the representative of an applicant for or proprietor of a European patent or of their being prevented for legal reasons resulting from action taken against their property from continuing the proceedings before the EPO.

In principle, the EPO interrupts proceedings pursuant to Rule 142 ex officio. In the case of Rule 142(1)(a) last sentence, however, proceedings are interrupted on request only.

Rule 142(1)(c)1.2 Responsible department

The Legal Division of the EPO bears sole responsibility for the interruption and resumption of proceedings under Rule 142 (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 21 November 2013, OJ EPO 2013, 600).

Art. 201.3 Date of interruption

An interruption is registered (in general retroactively) with legal effect from the date of the occurrence of the event. In cases where proceedings are interrupted on request, the interruption is effected as from the date of receipt of the request at the EPO.

The parties are informed of the interruption of proceedings and the reasons for it. The date of interruption as well as the date of resumption of proceedings are recorded in the European Patent Register.

Rule 143(1)(t)1.4 Resumption of proceedings

When, in the cases referred to in Rule 142(1)(a) or Rule 142(1)(b), the EPO has been informed of the identity of the person authorised to continue the proceedings before the EPO, it notifies that person and, where applicable, any third party, that the proceedings will be resumed as from a specified date. The date is set in such a manner as to allow this person to familiarise himself with the matter.

If, three years after the publication of the date of interruption in the European Patent Bulletin, the EPO has not been informed of the identity of the person authorised to continue the proceedings, it may set a date on which it intends to resume the proceedings of its own motion.

This date may be postponed upon reasoned request and submission of relevant documentary evidence in the case of a claim of succession in title in respect of the European patent application/European patent concerned.

As a consequence of the ex officio resumption, the proceedings will continue with the applicant/proprietor registered in the European Patent Register, and procedural actions may become necessary and/or fees due (see also the notice from the EPO dated 29 May 2020, OJ EPO 2020, A76).

Communications and decisions of the EPO which have been notified during the interruption period are to be regarded as null and void and will be notified anew after resumption of proceedings by the responsible department.

Rule 142(2)

In the case referred to in Rule 142(1)(c), the proceedings will be resumed when the EPO has been informed of the appointment of a new representative of the applicant or when the EPO has notified to the other parties the communication of the appointment of a new representative of the proprietor of the patent. If, the EPO has not been informed of the appointment of a new representative within a period of three months after the beginning of the interruption of the proceedings, it communicates to the applicant for or proprietor of the patent:

Rule 142(3)

(i)where Art. 133(2) (mandatory appointment of a representative) is applicable, that the European patent application will be deemed to be withdrawn or the European patent will be revoked if the information is not submitted within two months after this communication is notified; or

Rule 142(3)(a)

(ii)where Art. 133(2) is not applicable, that the proceedings will be resumed with the applicant for or proprietor of the patent as from the date on which this communication is notified.

A copy of the communication will be forwarded to the other parties.

Rule 142(3)(b)1.5 Resumption of time limits

Time limits in force on the date of interruption of the proceedings begin again, in their original length, as from the day on which the proceedings are resumed, with the exception of the time limits for requesting examination and for paying renewal fees.

If the time limit for filing the request for examination is in force on the date of interruption of the proceedings, it is suspended (J 7/83; see also E‑VIII, 1.4). Thereafter it resumes for the time it still has to run, or for at least the two months prescribed by Rule 142(4), second sentence.

Concerning renewal fees falling due during the period of interruption, Rule 142(4) has to be interpreted as deferring the due date for their payment until the date the proceedings are resumed (J 902/87). Thus, such renewal fees may be paid without additional fee at the date of resumption and in the amounts applicable on that date. They may also be paid within six months of said date, provided that an additional fee is also paid within said period (Rule 51(2)).

If the time limit for paying renewal fees with the additional fee referred to in Rule 51(2) is in force on the date of interruption of the proceedings, it is suspended and begins to run again for the remaining period on the date of resumption.

Rule 142(4)2. Stay of proceedings under Rule 14 due to pending national entitlement proceedings

If third parties provide evidence that they have instituted proceedings against the applicant seeking a decision within the meaning of Art. 61(1), the proceedings for grant are stayed unless the third parties communicate to the EPO in writing their consent to the continuation of proceedings. This consent is irrevocable. For further details see A‑IV, 2.2 and subsections, and D‑VII, 4.1.

Rule 14(1)3. Stay of proceedings when a referral to the Enlarged Board of Appeal is pending

Where a referral to the Enlarged Board of Appeal is pending and the outcome of examination or opposition proceedings depends entirely on the answer to the questions referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal, the proceedings may be stayed by the examining or opposition division on its own initiative or on request of a party or the parties.

The party/ies will be informed of the intention to stay the proceedings. If no reply is received from the party/ies with regard to the intention to stay, or if the party/ies explicitly agree(s), the proceedings will be stayed and the party/ies will be informed thereof. If the party/ies do(es) not agree in writing with the intention to stay, and if the examining or opposition division maintains its opinion, a decision to stay will be despatched. A decision to stay the proceedings or refusing a request to stay is not separately appealable; it can only be appealed together with the final decision on the application/patent (see E‑X, 3).

During the stay of proceedings, a PACE request will have no effect. After their resumption, proceedings are again accelerated. Where the proceedings are not stayed, they will be decided according to existing practice.

A stay of proceedings due to dependency on a referral to the Enlarged Board of Appeal is to be distinguished from a stay of proceedings pursuant to Rule 14 (see E‑VII, 2).4. Consolidation of proceedings

The examining or opposition division or the Legal Division may consolidate proceedings if this is considered useful in order to expedite proceedings in the specific circumstances of the case (see J 17/92).

Consolidation is considered inter alia if the parties and the underlying facts of the proceedings are identical. It is for the responsible division to decide whether proceedings are to be consolidated in the interest of procedural efficiency and with a view to expediting proceedings and, if so, for what purpose. Consolidation may concern the entire procedure or only individual procedural steps such as the taking of evidence or the conduct of oral proceedings.

The parties are to be informed of consolidation. This information includes a statement about the purpose of consolidation. Where proceedings are consolidated for the taking of evidence, this is to be notified in the order to take evidence and in the annex to the summons to oral proceedings. These must be sent to all parties to the consolidated proceedings. Likewise, submissions from the parties filed in respect of only one of the proceedings which are relevant to the consolidated parts of the proceedings must be included in all the files concerned.

Upon fulfilment of its purpose, consolidation is to be set aside and the proceedings are to be continued separately. Again, the parties must be informed accordingly.

A decision to consolidate proceedings is not subject to a separate appeal but may be appealed only together with the final decision unless the decision allows a separate appeal (see E‑X, 3). The same applies mutatis mutandis to a decision setting aside consolidation.Chapter VIII – Time limits, loss of rights, further and accelerated processing and re-establishment of rights

1.5 Effect of change in priority date

1.6 Extension of a time limit

1.7 Late receipt of documents

1.8 Failure to respond within a time limit

1.9 Loss of rights1.1 Determination of time limits

The EPC imposes time limits upon parties to proceedings. In the EPC, a "time limit" is a period of time of defined duration, calculated in full years, months, weeks or days, by reference to a relevant event (J 18/04), within which an act vis-à-vis the EPO has to be completed.

Some of these are fixed by the articles of the EPC, e.g. Art. 87(1) (priority period) and Art. 99(1) (opposition). Others are fixed in the Implementing Regulations, e.g. in Rule 30(3) (payment of late-furnishing fee), Rule 38 (payment of filing and search fee), Rule 39(1) (payment of designation fees), Rule 58 (correction of deficiencies in application documents), Rule 70(1) (request for examination), Rule 71(3) (filing translations of the claims and payment of fees for grant and publishing) and Rule 112(2) (applying for a decision after notification of loss of rights).

Others take the form of a stipulated range, the precise period within this range being at the EPO's discretion.

In other cases, e.g. those dealt with in Rule 3(3) (filing translation of documentary evidence), or Rule 70(2) (invitation to applicants to indicate whether they desire to proceed further with the European patent application), a period, but not its duration, is provided for in the EPC. The duration must be specified by the EPO in accordance with Rule 132 (see E‑VIII, 1.2).

Art. 120 Rule 1311.2 Duration of the periods to be specified by the EPO on the basis of EPC provisions

The length of such periods is based, in principle, on the amount of work which is likely to be required to perform the operation in question (minimum of two months, maximum of four months, exceptionally six months). However, in order to facilitate the work of parties and the EPO it has been decided, as a general rule, to adopt a uniform practice with respect to time limits. This practice is at present as follows:

(i)if deficiencies to be corrected are merely formal or merely of a minor character; if simple acts only are requested, e.g. under Rule 83 the subsequent filing of documents referred to by a party; or if observations are required on amendments which are merely of a minor character – two months;

(ii)communications from an examining or opposition division raising matters of substance – four months;

(iii)communications from the Legal Division – two months.

Where a communication according to Art. 94(3) in examination is accompanied by a request for a translation of a priority document (Rule 53(3)), the period set for reply to that communication and for providing the translation is the same and is at least four months, regardless of the severity of the objections raised in the communication according to Art. 94(3) (see also A‑III, 6.8.2).

A longer time limit of up to six months is set only in the exceptional cases where it is clear that in the circumstances a four-month time limit cannot be adhered to. Each case must be judged on its individual merits and it is difficult to give general guidance, but a six-month time limit might be justified if for example the subject-matter of the application or patent or the objections raised are exceptionally complicated. Note that in this case an extension of the time limit (i.e. beyond six months) will be allowed only in exceptional cases (E‑VIII, 1.6). Where the applicant is invited to submit the indication provided for in Rule 70(2), a six-month time limit running from the publication of the search report is appropriate.

Rule 70(2)1.3 Time limits which may be freely determined

Time limits for operations in respect of which the setting of a time limit is not explicitly provided for in the EPC are not subject to the restrictions as to the duration of time limits laid down in Rule 132. They may be fixed by the EPO at its own discretion.1.4 Calculation of time limits

Although Rule 131 allows other possibilities, any period fixed by the EPO will usually be specified in full months which will be calculated from the date of notification (see E‑II, 2). Rule 131 gives precise details for the determination of the day of expiry of the period, whilst Rule 134 contains provisions covering certain contingencies (see E‑VIII, 1.6).

Rule 131 Rule 134

When proceedings have been interrupted because of the death of the applicant or proprietor or for any of the other reasons specified in Rule 142 (see E‑VII, 1.1), time limits are subject to the provisions of Rule 142(4). The time limits for the payment of the examination fee and the renewal fees are suspended (see E‑VII, 1.5). The time limits in force at the date of the stay of proceedings under Rule 14 due to national entitlement proceedings, with the exception of those for payment of the renewal fees, are interrupted. Rule 14(4) applies to the calculation of time limits after the resumption of proceedings (see A‑IV, 2.2.4).

Rule 1421.5 Effect of change in priority date

Certain time limits run from the date of priority, or in the case of multiple priorities, from the earliest date of priority. Where this date no longer applies (e.g. the right of priority is lost in accordance with the provisions of Art. 90(5)), any such time limits become determinable from the amended date of priority. This does not restore any loss of rights resulting from a time limit having already expired before the loss of priority date. For example, if a request for restoration of a priority right is filed upon entry into the European phase on expiry of the 31-month time limit under Rule 159(1) but the request is not granted resulting in the loss of the right of priority, the 31-month time limit will not be deferred. Part A of the Guidelines deals with the procedure to be followed (see A‑III, 6.9 to A-III, 6.11).

Art. 88(2)1.6 Extension of a time limit

1.6.1 Extension of time limits set by the EPO under Rule 132

1.6.2 Extension of periods under Rule 1341.6.1 Extension of time limits set by the EPO under Rule 132

Other than in cases in respect of which the EPC specifies a fixed period which may not be extended, the duration of time limits may be extended on request. The request must be submitted in writing before expiry of the period that has been set. The extended period is to be calculated from the start of the original period.

In opposition proceedings, requests to extend time limits over and above the normal period of four months, both for communications from an opposition division raising matters of substance and communications issued by the formalities officer, or two months for communications requesting an act of a merely formal or minor character (E‑VIII, 1.2), will only be granted in exceptional, duly substantiated cases. For a communication under Art. 101(1) and Rule 79 or Rule 81(2) and Rule 81(3), all parties to the proceedings can request an extension irrespective of whether they were invited in the communication to reply: if the extension is, exceptionally, granted to one of the parties, it automatically applies to all other parties.

In other proceedings, a request for extension, even if filed without reasons, is normally allowed if it is for not more than two months and the total period set does not thereby exceed six months. A request for a longer extension, especially if the total period set exceeds six months, is allowed only exceptionally, when the reasons given are sufficient to show convincingly that a reply in the period previously set will not be possible. Such exceptional circumstances might be e.g. the fact that representatives or clients are so seriously ill that they cannot deal with the case in time; or the need to perform extensive biological experiments or tests. On the other hand, foreseeable or avoidable circumstances (e.g. leave, pressure of other work) are not accepted as a sufficiently exceptional circumstance (see Notice of the Vice-President of Directorate-General 2 of the EPO, OJ EPO 1989, 180).

If the request for an extension is granted, the parties are informed of the new time limit. Otherwise, they are told that the relevant sanction has taken effect or will take effect.

An application will be removed from the PACE programme (see E‑VIII, 4) if the applicant has requested an extension of a time limit (OJ EPO 2015, A93, point A.4).

In examination proceedings, failure to respond to a communication according to Art. 94(3) results in deemed withdrawal of the application (see E‑VIII, 1.8 and E‑VIII, 1.9.2).

Rule 132

If the request for extension of a time limit filed in good time has been rejected and any applicant considers this unjust, they can only overcome the ensuing loss of rights by requesting a decision under Rule 112(2) and/or further processing under Art. 121(1) and Rule 135(1) (see E‑VIII, 2), as applicable. Where the reimbursement of the fee for further processing is requested and this is rejected, such decision is open to appeal, either together with the final decision or separately, as the case may be (see J 37/89).

The failure of a party to reply to a communication from the opposition division within the period set does not lead directly to any legal consequence. Rather, the opposition proceedings will proceed to the next stage, and this could be a decision under Art. 101(2) or Art. 101(3).

Art. 106(2)1.6.2 Extension of periods under Rule 134

1.6.2.1 Extension of periods under Rule 134(1)

1.6.2.2 Extension of periods under Rule 134(2) and Rule 134(5)

1.6.2.3 Scope of application of Rule 1341.6.2.1 Extension of periods under Rule 134(1)

Periods that expire on a day on which at least one of the filing offices of the European Patent Office (i.e. Munich, The Hague or Berlin) is not open for receipt of documents (e.g. because a public holiday is observed at the location of the EPO's filing office) or on which mail is not delivered for other reasons (with the exception of a general dislocation in the transmission or delivery of mail, which is subject to the provision of Rule 134(2) – see E‑VIII, 1.6.2.3) are extended to the first day thereafter on which all the filing offices are open again for receipt of documents and on which mail is delivered.

An extension pursuant to Rule 134(1) also applies in the event that any one of the means of electronic filing provided by the EPO under Rule 2(1) is not available, regardless of any restrictions on the documents which may be filed by the means of electronic filing that suffered the outage.

– If a means of electronic filing is unavailable for four hours or more because of scheduled maintenance, Rule 134(1), second sentence, applies. If the unavailability of a means of electronic filing lasts less than four hours and is announced at least two working days in advance, Rule 134(1), second sentence, does not apply.

– In the case of unplanned outages, users who are unable to file a document should contact the EPO's Customer Services. If it is confirmed that the unavailability of the service is attributable to the EPO, said users will not suffer any adverse consequences; they may also request that the EPO declare under Rule 134(1), second sentence, that the missed period is extended to the date on which the document was filed.

– If a payment period expires on a day on which one of the accepted means of making payment to the EPO for a Euro-direct or Euro-PCT application is unavailable, the payment period is extended to the first working day thereafter on which all such means of making payment are available unless the outage lasts less than four hours and is announced at least two working days in advance.

For further details see OJ EPO 2020, A120.

Rule 134(1)1.6.2.2 Extension of periods under Rule 134(2) and Rule 134(5)

Where there is a general dislocation in the delivery or transmission of mail in a contracting state, any period expiring during such dislocation is extended for parties who are resident in the state concerned or have appointed a representative with a place if business in that state. Where the state concerned is the state in which the EPO is located, the extension applies to all parties and representatives, irrespective of their residence. The beginning and the end of the period of such general dislocation is published in the Official Journal.

Rule 134(2) and (4)

Equally, where an individual party can provide evidence of a dislocation of the delivery or transmission of mail due to an exceptional occurrence inside or outside EPC contracting states (such as, in particular, a natural disaster, war, civil disorder or a general breakdown of any of the means of electronic communication accepted by the EPO for the filing of documents), a late submission or payment will be deemed to be received in due time, provided that

– the dislocation affected the locality where that party or their representative resides or has their principal place of business,

– the dislocation existed on any of the last ten days of the period at issue, and

– the transmission or payment is effected within five days from the end of the dislocation, together with

– a formal request of the party concerned under Rule 134(5), accompanied by appropriate evidence.

Rule 134(5)1.6.2.3 Scope of application of Rule 134

An extension under Rule 134 applies to all periods under the EPC (see E‑VIII, 1.1), including, in particular:

– the time limits for the filing of submissions, e.g. replies to EPO communications;

– the time limit under Rule 37(2) for the onward transmission to the EPO of applications filed with the central industrial property office of a contracting state (see A‑II, 1.6);

– the priority period under Art. 87(1) (see A‑III, 6.6);

– the opposition period under Art. 99(1);

– the period for entry into the European phase under Rule 159(1);

– the periods for the payment of fees (see A‑X, 6.1), including, mutatis mutandis, the expiry of the period to pay renewal fees with an additional fee in accordance with Rule 51(2) and the expiry of the periods under Rule 51(3) and Rule 51(4) (see A‑X, 5.2.4).

By contrast, an extension under Rule 134 does not affect:

– the pendency of the earlier application when filing a divisional application (see A‑IV, 1.1.1);

– the beginning of the six-month period for the payment of a renewal fee with an additional fee under Rule 51(2) unless the due date for the renewal fee is deferred to the expiry of a period, for instance in the case of Rule 159(1)(g) (see A‑X, 5.2.4);

– the due date for the renewal fees for a divisional application and the beginning of the four-month period under Rule 51(3) (see A‑IV, 1.4.3);

– the date of the start of the search, which is relevant for the entitlement to a refund of the search fee (see A‑X, 10.2.1);

– the date of the start of substantive examination, which is relevant for filing a PPH request (see E‑VIII, 4.3) or the entitlement to a refund of the examination fee (see A‑VI, 2.5);

– the date on which a request under Rule 22 (registration of transfers) or Rule 54 (certified priority document) is deemed to be filed, where the payment date is decisive, because these requests are deemed to have been filed only when the corresponding administrative fee has been paid.

The extension equally does not affect the final date for making written submissions in preparation for oral proceedings under Rule 116, strictly speaking. However, a general dislocation in the delivery of mail or other exceptional occurrence under Rule 134(5) will be taken into account by an examining or opposition division in exercising its discretion whether to admit submissions filed after the date set under Rule 116 (see E‑III, 8.5, sub-item (iv)). Given that the date fixed under Rule 116 is meant to ensure adequate preparation of the oral proceedings, a party making submissions after that date must show that it has taken reasonable efforts to do so as early as reasonably possible.1.7 Late receipt of documents

If a document received late was delivered to a recognised postal service provider at least five days before expiry of the time limit and was received no later than three months after expiry of the time limit, it will be deemed to have been received in due time under Rule 133. The five days are calendar days, not working days. This legal fiction applies to all time limits to be observed vis-à-vis the EPO and/or the national authorities, including the priority period laid down in Art. 87(1). Despite this legal fiction that the time limit has been observed, the filing date of the document remains the day on which it was actually received.

Recognised postal service providers are the designated operators within the meaning of Article 1 of the Universal Postal Convention as well as Chronopost, DHL, Federal Express, flexpress, TNT, SkyNet, UPS and Transworld (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 11 March 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A29). The document must have been sent as a registered letter or equivalent and, if posted outside Europe, by airmail. At the request of the EPO, confirmation of receipt by the postal service provider must be provided as evidence that the document was delivered in due time.

Rule 133(1)1.8 Failure to respond within a time limit

If a party has not acted within a time limit, various sanctions may be applied depending on the circumstances. For instance, under Art. 90(2) and Rule 55 the application will not be proceeded with; under Art. 90(5) the application will be refused or a right of priority lost; under Rule 5 a document may be deemed not to have been received. If the request for examination has not been filed in time, the application is deemed to be withdrawn (Art. 94(2)), and this sanction may also apply in those cases where the applicant fails to meet a time limit set by the EPO (e.g. the time limit for replying to an invitation to amend under Art. 94(3)).

If a particular time limit is not complied with and, in contrast to cases where mandatory legal sanctions are laid down (e.g. revocation of the European patent if the publishing fee is not paid in due time (Rule 82(3)), no specific legal sanction is laid down in the EPC, submissions and requests from the parties made after expiry of the time limit but before a decision is handed over to the EPO's internal postal service for transmittal to the parties are to be regarded in the rest of the proceedings as if they had been received in time (see G 12/91); any facts or evidence are, however, to be treated as not filed in due time (Art. 114(2), see also E‑VI, 1.2).1.9 Loss of rights

1.9.1 Cases of loss of rights

1.9.2 Noting and communication of loss of rights

1.9.3 Decision on loss of rights1.9.1 Cases of loss of rights

If a party to the proceedings or a third party fails to comply with a time limit laid down in the EPC or fixed by the EPO, this will result in a loss of rights in certain cases specified in the EPC, without any decision concerning the refusal of the European patent application or the grant, revocation or maintenance of the European patent, or the taking of evidence.

Rule 1121.9.2 Noting and communication of loss of rights

If there has been a loss of any right as described in E‑VIII, 1.9.1, a formalities officer will note such loss of rights and communicate this to the person concerned. The communication will be notified to the person concerned as a matter of course (see also D‑IV, 1.4.1).

Art. 119 Rule 112(1)1.9.3 Decision on loss of rights

If the party concerned considers that the finding of the EPO is inaccurate, they may, within two months after notification of the communication, apply for a decision on the matter by the EPO.

The competent department of the EPO will give such a decision only if it does not share the opinion of the person requesting it; otherwise it will inform the person requesting the decision and then continue with the proceedings. Since such decisions are subject to appeal, the reasons on which they are based must be stated. Only the person affected by the loss of rights noted will be party to the proceedings.

The request under Rule 112(2) for a review of the accuracy of the communication under Rule 112(1) exists in parallel to the legal remedies against the loss of rights. It is advisable to apply for the appropriate legal remedy as an auxiliary request to that under Rule 112(2) in order to observe the relevant time limit for that request (see E‑VIII, 2 and E‑VIII, 3.1.3). The competent department will deal with the request under Rule 112(2) first. If it is allowable, all other requests are redundant and any related fees paid will be refunded. If it is not allowable, one decision will deal with the various requests in the order in which they were filed. If applicants fail to observe the time limit for requesting a decision under Rule 112(2), they may still apply for re-establishment of rights under Art. 122(1) and Rule 136(1) in respect of that time limit.

Rule 112(2)2. Further processing

If the European patent application is to be refused or is refused or deemed to be withdrawn following failure to reply within a time limit vis-à-vis the EPO, the application is allowed to proceed if the applicant makes a request for further processing of the application within two months of the communication concerning either the failure to observe a time limit or a loss of rights. Further processing must be requested by payment of the prescribed fee. The omitted act must be completed within the period for making the request. The request is not deemed to have been filed until the respective fee for further processing has been paid. If the fee for further processing has been paid in due time but the omitted act has not been completed within the period for making the request, the request is inadmissible.

If several acts have the same legal basis, they form a unitary procedural act and are subject to a unitary time limit (see J 26/95). Further processing in respect of such a time limit is subject to the payment of a single fee for further processing. The amount of the single fee depends on the number and character of the omitted acts forming the unitary procedural act.

The following examples serve to illustrate this:

– Requesting examination under Art. 94(1) in conjunction with Rule 70(1) requires filing a written request for examination and paying the examination fee. As both actions have the same legal basis, they form a unitary procedural act subject to a unitary time limit. If both actions were omitted, the single fee for further processing amounts to the sum of the flat fee and 50% of the examination fee (Art. 2(1), item 12 RFees, first and third indents, RFees). If only the examination fee was not paid in due time, the fee for further processing amounts to 50% of the examination fee (Art. 2(1), item 12 RFees, first indent, RFees). If only the written request for examination was omitted, the fee for further processing amounts to the flat fee (Art. 2(1), item 12 RFees, third indent, RFees).

– The filing fee and the additional fee due if the application comprises more than 35 pages must be paid within the time limit set by Rule 38(1) and (2). As the additional fee is part of the filing fee, the payment of these two fees forms a unitary procedural act subject to a unitary time limit. Hence, one fee for further processing is due. If both fees were not paid in due time, the single fee for further processing comprises 50% of the filing fee and 50% of the additional fee (see Art. 2(1), item 12 RFees, first indent, RFees). If only one fee was not paid in due time, the single fee for further processing amounts to 50% of that omitted fee (see Art. 2(1), item 12 RFees, first indent, RFees).

An exception to the above principle concerns Rule 71(3):

– Approval of the text communicated under Rule 71(3) requires paying the fee for grant and publishing and, where applicable, claims fees (Rule 71(4)) and filing the translations of the claims within a four-month period (Rule 71(5)). As these actions have the same legal basis, they form a unitary procedural act subject to a unitary time limit. By way of exception to the principle that the single fee for further processing is computed on the basis of the number of omitted acts, Art. 2(1), item 12 RFees, second indent, RFees stipulates that only one flat fee for further processing is due in the event of late performance of any or all of the acts required under Rule 71(3), i.e. paying the fee for grant and publishing and filing the translations of the claims. If in addition claims fees were not paid in due time, the single fee for further processing amounts to the sum of the flat fee and 50% of the claims fees (see Art. 2(1), item 12 RFees, second and first indent, RFees). If only the claims fees were not paid in due time, the single fee for further processing amounts to 50% of the claims fees (Art. 2(1), item 12 RFees, first indent, RFees). For European patent applications filed before 1 April 2009 and international applications entering the European phase before that date, any page fees under Art. 2(2), item 7.2, RFees are part of the fee for grant and printing. Therefore, if only page fees were not paid in due time, the fee for further processing amounts to the flat fee (Art. 2(1), item 12 RFees, second indent, RFees).

Actions not forming a unitary procedural act are subject to time limits expiring independently of one another, each resulting in the application being deemed withdrawn. If such time limits expire on the same date, the missing of each independent time limit results in the application being deemed withdrawn (see J 26/95). This applies regardless of whether the applicant is informed of the non-performance of procedural acts in one communication or in several communications. In such cases, a fee for further processing is due in respect of each unobserved time limit. For an example, see E‑VIII, 3.1.3.

A request for further processing may also be filed between expiry of the unobserved time limit and notification of the communication concerning either the failure to observe a time limit or a loss of rights.

The department competent to decide on the omitted act also decides on the request for further processing.

Where the omitted act is a substantive response (e.g. to the extended European search report or to a communication under Art. 94(3)), a mere procedural request (e.g. a request for oral proceedings) does not qualify as completion of the omitted act and therefore cannot lead to further processing being granted (see B‑XI, 8 and C‑IV, 3).

Art. 121(1) and Art. 121(2) Rule 135(1) and Rule 135(3) Art. 2(1), item 12, RFees

As a general rule, further processing is the legal remedy for failure to observe a time limit during proceedings before grant, even where the consequence is a partial loss of rights (e.g. loss of priority right). However, the possibility of requesting further processing is ruled out for the periods referred to in Art. 121(4) and Rules 6(1), Rule 16(1)(a), Rule 31(2), Rule 36(2), Rule 40(3), Rule 51(2) to Rule 51(5), Rule 52(2) and Rule 52(3), Rule 55, Rule 56, Rule 56a(1) and Rule 56a(3) to Rule 56a(7), Rule 58, Rule 59, Rule 62a, Rule 63, Rule 64, Rule 112(2) and Rule 164(1) and Rule 164(2).

Rule 135(2)3. Re-establishment of rights

An applicant for or proprietor of a European patent who, despite taking all due care required by the circumstances, was unable to observe a time limit vis-à-vis the EPO may apply to have their rights re-established.

Art. 122(1)

3.1 Admissibility of the request

3.2 Merit of the request

3.3 Decision on re-establishment of rights3.1 Admissibility of the request

3.1.1 Time limits covered

3.1.2 Entitlement to file the request

3.1.3 Form of the request and applicable time limit

3.1.4 Substantiation of the request3.1.1 Time limits covered

Failure to observe the time limit must have the direct consequence of causing the refusal of the European patent application or of a request, or the deeming of the European patent application to have been withdrawn, or the revocation of the European patent, or the loss of any other right or means of redress. This means, for example, that in opposition proceedings there can be no re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limits for the patent proprietor's submission of observations on the written statements of the other parties to the proceedings or on communications from the opposition division. Likewise, there can be no re-establishment of rights in case of failure to observe the time limit for the payment of the renewal fees under Rule 51(1) as valid payment is still possible under Rule 51(2).

Art. 122(1)

Re-establishment of rights is ruled out in respect of all periods for which further processing is available and in respect of the period for requesting re-establishment of rights. This means that re-establishment of rights comes into play where further processing is excluded in respect of a specific period or where the time limit for requesting further processing has expired. In the latter case, re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for requesting further processing is to be requested (see E‑VIII, 2), and not in respect of the originally missed time limit.

Art. 122(4) Rule 136(3)

A "time limit" is taken to mean a specific period of time within which an act vis-à-vis the EPO must be completed (see E‑VIII, 1.1). Re-establishment of rights is therefore not admissible e.g. in respect of failure to be present on the date of appointed oral proceedings.

The following are examples of cases where re-establishment of rights may be requested. They concern the time limits for:

Rule 131(1)

– payment of a renewal fee plus additional fee;

Rule 51(2)

– requesting further processing in respect of the time limit for replying to a communication from the examining division under Art. 94(3);

Rule 135(1)

– filing the translation of any amended claims in opposition proceedings;

Rule 82(2)

– filing the request for a decision by the opposition division on the awarding of costs;

Rule 88(3)

– filing notice of appeal and/or grounds of appeal; and

Art. 108

– filing a petition for review by the Enlarged Board of Appeal.

Art. 112a(4)3.1.2 Entitlement to file the request

The wording of Art. 122(1) implies that re-establishment of rights is available only to applicants and proprietors. Therefore, opponents are in principle not entitled to request re-establishment of rights, e.g. in respect of the time limit for filing an appeal (see T 210/89). However, an opponent who has filed an appeal can request re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for submitting the grounds for appeal (see G 1/86).

Where re-establishment of rights is requested by the patent proprietor in respect of a time limit connected with the opposition procedure, the opponents are party to the re-establishment proceedings (see T 552/02 and T 1561/05).

In the case of transfer of an application or patent, the request for re-establishment of rights may only be filed by the registered applicant (E‑XIV, 3).

Rule 22(3)3.1.3 Form of the request and applicable time limit

As a rule, the request for re-establishment of rights must be filed in writing within two months from the removal of the cause of non-compliance with the time limit, but at the latest within one year of expiry of the unobserved time limit. The omitted act must be completed within this period.

Where the "cause of non-compliance with the time limit" involved some error in the carrying out of the party's intention to comply with the time limit, the removal of the cause of non-compliance occurs on the date on which the person responsible for the application is made aware of the fact that a time limit has not been observed or ought to have noticed the error if all due care had been taken. The removal of the cause of non-compliance is a matter of fact which has to be determined in the circumstances of each individual case. In the absence of circumstances to the contrary, where a communication under Rule 112(1) has been duly sent, it may be assumed that the removal was effected by receipt of this communication (see J 27/90).

Unlike the time limit for other cases as described above, a request for re-establishment in respect of the priority period (Art. 87(1)) or the period for filing a petition for review by the Enlarged Board of Appeal (Art. 112a(4)) must be filed within two months of expiry of the relevant period.

A request for re-establishment is not deemed to be filed until after the fee for the re-establishment of rights has been paid.

The principles regarding unitary and independent procedural acts described in E‑VIII, 2 apply mutatis mutandis to establishing the number of requests for re-establishment of rights, in particular for establishing the relevant fees to be paid. Where one unitary procedural act is omitted by not performing one or more actions forming that act, only one fee for re-establishment is due. Where several independent procedural acts are omitted, each resulting in the application being deemed withdrawn, a fee for re-establishment is due for each omitted act.

These principles also apply to cases where re-establishment of rights must be requested in respect of the time limit(s) for requesting further processing (see Rule 136(3)). In such cases, the number of unobserved time limits, each resulting in the application being deemed withdrawn and requiring a request for further processing, determines the number of requests for re-establishment and the corresponding number of fees for re-establishment.

Example 1

An international application comprises more than 35 pages and was published in a language other than an official language of the EPO. The acts required for entry into the European phase upon expiry of the 31-month period under Rule 159(1) were omitted. Due to their different legal nature, the individual acts required under Rule 159(1) do not form a unitary procedural step but are legally independent and subject to independent time limits. The table below provides a schematic illustration regarding further processing and re-establishment of rights (for information on the remedies available for non-observance of the time limits under Rule 159(1), see the individual sections under E‑IX, 2).

Box I of the table lists the number of independent unobserved time limits. Box II indicates the fee for further processing corresponding to each unobserved time limit. Box III provides the fee for re-establishment corresponding to each unobserved time limit.

In the example, for a request for further processing to be allowed, completion of the omitted acts (i.e. all acts that were to be performed within the 31-month period) and payment of five fees for further processing (two of which comprise two fees) are required within the two-month period under Rule 135(1). If that period is missed, the applicant may request re-establishment of rights in respect of the period. The request requires completion of the omitted acts and payment of the corresponding number of fees for re-establishment of rights within the period under Rule 136(1). The omitted acts are those that were to be performed within the 31-month period and payment of the corresponding five fees for further processing. Payment of five fees for re-establishment of rights corresponds to the number of five independent fees for further processing.

Omitted acts Time limits missed (box I) Number of fees for further processing (box II) Number of fees for re-establishment (box III) Filing of the translation 1 1 1 Payment of the filing fee 1 (unitary) 1 (comprising 50% of the filing fee and 50% of the additional fee) 1 Payment of the additional fee for an application comprising more than 35 pages Payment of the designation fee 1 1 1 Payment of the search fee 1 1 1 Filing of the request for examination 1 (unitary) 1 (comprising a flat fee and 50% of the examination fee) 1 Payment of the examination fee Resulting number of fees to be paid 5 non-observed time limits 5 fees for further processing, 2 of them comprising 2 fees 5 fees for re-establishment

Example 2

The applicant missed the time limit for requesting further processing in respect of the time limit for replying to a communication from the examining division under Art. 94(3) as well as the time limit to pay the renewal fee with the additional fee. As these time limits expire independently of one another and both have been missed by the applicant, each resulting in the application being deemed withdrawn, a request for re-establishment has to be filed in respect of each unobserved time limit (J 26/95). In such cases, a fee for re-establishment has to be paid in respect of each request. In the case of independent time limits, in particular where they expire on different dates, the reasons for missing them and the date of removal of the cause of non-compliance may be different.

Example 3

After a decision to refuse by the examining division, the applicant missed both the time limit for filing the notice and the time limit for filing the statement of grounds of appeal. Both time limits were missed for the same reason. Despite two time limits being missed, only one re-establishment fee has to be paid as both periods were triggered by the same event, i.e. the notification of the decision, and both time limits were missed on the same grounds. In such a case, re-establishment in respect of both periods has to be examined together and, as the result would inevitably be the same in both cases, one re-establishment fee is considered to be sufficient.

If the time limits for filing the notice and the grounds were missed for different reasons, there would be no causal connection and two fees for re-establishment would have to be paid.

Rule 136(1), Rule 136(2)3.1.4 Substantiation of the request

The request must state the grounds on which it is based, and must set out the facts on which it relies. Thus, it must set forth the precise cause of non-compliance with the time limit concerned (i.e. the fact or obstacle preventing the required action within the time limit), specify at what time and under which circumstances the cause occurred and was removed, and present the core facts making it possible to consider whether all due care required by the circumstances had been taken in order to comply with the time limit concerned (see J 15/10). General statements with no indication of the concrete facts or events that caused the time limit to be missed do not satisfy the requirement for a duly substantiated request under Rule 136(2).

Once the time limit for filing the request for re-establishment has expired, the requester may clarify or supplement the alleged facts and, where appropriate, submit further evidence. However, the requester cannot alter the factual basis on which the original request for re-establishment had been based (see J 5/94). Any new facts introduced at this stage are not admissible and are, therefore, not taken into consideration by the deciding instance.3.2 Merit of the request

Applicants can have their rights re-established only if they show that they were unable to observe a time limit vis-à-vis the EPO in spite of all due care required by the circumstances having been taken. The obligation to exercise due care must be considered in the light of the situation as it stood before the missed time limit expired. "All due care" means all reasonable care, i.e. the standard of care that the notional reasonably competent patentee, applicant or representative would employ in all the relevant circumstances (see T 30/90).

For cases where the cause of non-compliance with a time limit involves some error in the carrying out of the party's intention to comply with the time limit, all due care is considered to have been taken if non-compliance with the time limit results either from exceptional circumstances or from an isolated mistake within a normally satisfactory monitoring system.

A finding of exceptional circumstances justifying the re-establishment of rights is dependent on the individual facts of the case. Examples include inter alia organisational upheavals and sudden serious illnesses. In such cases, the requesters must show not only the existence of those circumstances, but also that they took all due care, e.g. by carefully preparing the reorganisation or by having an effective staff substitution system.

Where an isolated mistake within a normally satisfactory monitoring system is alleged, the relevant party must show that the monitoring system normally works well. Such a system must include an independent, effective cross-check mechanism. However, this requirement does not apply to relatively small entities/patent departments (see T 166/87 and J 11/03).

The duty to exercise all due care applies first and foremost to the applicants and then, by virtue of delegation, to the representative duly entrusted by the applicant to act on their behalf in prosecuting the application (see J 3/93). The obligations of the applicant and those of their representative are clearly distinct and depend on the relationship between them (see T 112/89 and J 19/04). In this regard, the scope of the mandate and any express instructions given to the representative are taken into account.

Applicants are entitled to rely on their representative. To the extent that applicants are on notice that instructions are required in order to meet a time limit, they have however a duty to take all due care in the circumstances to meet the time limit (see T 381/93). The fact that the professional representative has acted correctly does not exempt applicants from suffering the consequences of their own mistakes or negligence.

European representatives are responsible in the procedure before the EPO and must be presumed to be supervising their own work continuously (see T 1095/06). When professional representatives have been instructed by their client to perform a particular procedural action and do not receive in due time the necessary additional instructions or required means, they must in principle take all necessary measures to try to obtain these instructions from their client and ascertain their true wishes (see T 112/89 and J 19/04).

Professional representatives can delegate routine tasks, such as typing, posting letters, noting time limits or checking due dates, to assistants. In those cases, the same strict standard of care is not expected of the assistant as is demanded of the representative himself. The representative must however show that the assistants have been carefully selected, duly instructed and periodically supervised (see J 5/80 and T 439/06).

If the applicants entrust a further party with taking care of their application matters, e.g. a non-European representative or a fee payment agency, it has to be established that such a party has taken the due care required of an applicant for or proprietor of a European patent (see J 3/88). In particular, a non-European representative must also show that a reliable system for the monitoring of time limits was in place when the time limit was missed (see J 4/07).

Art. 122(1)3.3 Decision on re-establishment of rights

The department competent to decide on the omitted act is also competent to decide on the request for re-establishment of rights. The grounds for the decision need only be stated if the request is not granted, except in opposition proceedings, as opponents are party to the re-establishment proceedings (see E‑VIII, 3.1.2).

The department which took the contested decision will have to consider re-establishment of rights in respect of an unobserved time limit for appeal when the conditions for granting interlocutory revision are fulfilled (see E‑XII, 7). It can, however, only decide to allow re-establishment if it can do so within the three-month time limit of Art. 109(2) and the conditions for re-establishment (see E‑VIII, 3.1.1 to E‑VIII, 3.1.4) are fulfilled. In all other cases, the appeal, together with the application for the re-establishment of rights, must be submitted to the competent board of appeal.

Rule 136(4)

If the request is granted, the legal consequences of the failure to observe the time limit will be deemed not to have ensued. Any renewal fees which may have fallen due between the expiry of the missed time limit and the notification of the decision to grant the request for re-establishment will be due on that latter date. Valid payment will still be possible within four months of that date. If a renewal fee was already due when the loss of rights occurred but could still be paid under Rule 51(2), it may still be paid within six months of the date of notification of the decision re-establishing the rights, provided that the additional fee is also paid within that period.

If other time limits the non-observance of which would also lead to a loss of rights were already running when the loss of rights occurred, on granting the request for re-establishment the EPO will send the applicant a communication triggering those time limits anew.

Art. 122(3) Rule 51(4)4. Accelerated prosecution of European patent applications

Applicants requiring faster search or examination can ask to have their applications processed under the programme for accelerated prosecution of European patent applications (PACE) (see the notice from the EPO dated 30 November 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A93; for PACE requests filed before 1 January 2016 see also OJ EPO 2010, 352). For information regarding additional ways to expedite the European grant procedure see OJ EPO 2015, A94).

Requests for participation in the PACE programme (PACE requests) must be filed online using the dedicated request form (EPO Form 1005). The EPO will issue an acknowledgement of receipt promptly. Requests filed informally, i.e. without using the dedicated form, and/or on paper will not be processed by the EPO.

A PACE request may be filed only once during each stage of the procedure, i.e. search and examination, and for one application at a time. A PACE request filed during search will not trigger accelerated examination. If the applicant wishes to have the application examined in an accelerated manner, a PACE request may be filed, once the application has entered the examination phase.

The EPO does not publish requests for accelerated search and/or examination and, by decision of the President dated 12 July 2007 (Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, J.3), they are excluded from file inspection.

An application will be taken out of the PACE programme if:

– the PACE request has been withdrawn,

– the applicant has requested an extension of time limits,

– the application has been refused,

– the application has been withdrawn,

– the application is deemed to be withdrawn.

This applies regardless of the legal remedies available under the EPC. In such cases it will not be possible to restore the application to the PACE programme, i.e. a second request for that application during the same stage of the procedure will not be processed.

Additionally, accelerated prosecution will be suspended in the event of failure to pay renewal fees by the due date stipulated in Rule 51(1).

Accelerated prosecution under the PACE programme can be provided only where practically feasible and subject to the workload of the search and examining divisions. In certain technical fields there may be constraints due to the numbers of incoming PACE requests. Applicants requesting accelerated prosecution for all or most of their applications will, as a rule, be required by the EPO to limit the number of their PACE requests by making a selection.

4.1 Accelerated search

4.2 Accelerated examination

4.3 Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH)4.1 Accelerated search

For European patent applications filed on or after 1 July 2014 (including PCT applications entering the European phase where the EPO did not act as (S)ISA) the EPO strives to issue the extended/partial European search report within six months from the filing date or from expiry of the period under Rule 161(2). Hence, no PACE request is needed.

For European patent applications (including PCT applications entering the European phase where the EPO did not act as (S)ISA) which were filed before 1 July 2014 and which do claim priority (second filings), on receipt of a PACE request the EPO makes every effort to issue the extended/partial European search report within six months from receipt of the request.

Without prejudice to the above an accelerated search can only start:

(i)after receipt of the applicant's response to a communication under Rule 62a or Rule 63, or expiry of the respective time limit;

(ii)in all cases: when the application documents on filing are complete enough for the extended search report to be drawn up. That means, in particular, that the accelerated search can only start once the claims, the description, the translations required and, where applicable, the drawings and a sequence listing conforming to the rules for the standardised representation of nucleotide or amino acid sequences have been filed;

(iii)for PCT applications entering the European phase where the EPO did not act as (S)ISA: after expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161(2), even if acceleration has been requested under the PACE programme. In order for the supplementary European search to start immediately, on entry into the European phase the applicant must explicitly waive the right to communications pursuant to Rules 161(2) and 162(2) and pay any claims fees due (see the notice from the EPO dated 30 November 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A93).

If the EPO has invited the applicant to pay further search fee(s) under Rule 64(1), second sentence, or Rule 164(1)(b), the final search report under Rule 64(1), last sentence, or Rule 164(1)(c) cannot be drawn up until the applicant's response to the invitation to pay further search fee(s) has been received or until the respective time limit has expired.4.2 Accelerated examination

Accelerated examination can, in principle, be requested at any time after the examining division has assumed responsibility for the application (Rule 10(2), (3)).

For PCT applications entering the European phase where the EPO also acted as (S)ISA, accelerated examination can, in principle, be requested at any time, for example

– on entry into the European phase before the EPO, or

– together with any response to the WO‑ISA, IPER or SISR required under Rule 161(1).

When accelerated examination is requested, the EPO makes every effort to issue the next office action within three months of receipt by the examining division of the application, the applicant's response under Rule 70a or the end of the period under Rule 161(1), or the request for accelerated examination (whichever is later).

In particular for PCT applications entering the European phase where the EPO acted as (S)ISA, accelerated examination can only start after expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161(1), even if acceleration has been requested under the PACE programme. In order for examination to start immediately, on entry into the European phase the applicant must explicitly waive the right to the communication pursuant to Rule 161(1) and Rule 162(2) and fulfil all corresponding requirements (see the notice from the EPO dated 30 November 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A94).

The EPO strives to produce subsequent examination communications within three months of receipt of the applicant's reply, provided that the application is still being processed under the PACE programme (see E‑VIII, 4).4.3 Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH)

The Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) enables an applicant whose claims have been determined to be allowable to have a corresponding application which has been filed with a PPH partner office processed in an accelerated manner while at the same time allowing the offices involved to exploit available work results. A request before the EPO must be filed before substantive examination has begun.

A PPH request can be based on:

(i)the latest PCT work product (WO‑ISA or IPRP/IPER) established by one of the PPH partner offices as ISA or IPEA (PPH based on PCT work products); or

(ii)any national work product (office action indicating allowable claims) established during the processing of a national application or of a PCT application that has entered the national phase before one of the PPH partner offices (PPH based on national work products).

Currently, the EPO's PPH partner offices are: JPO (Japan), KIPO (South Korea), CNIPA (China), USPTO (USA), ILPO (Israel), CIPO (Canada), IMPI (Mexico), IPOS (Singapore), IPA (Australia), SIC (Colombia), MyIPO (Malaysia), IPOPHL (Philippines), INPI (Brazil), INDECOPI (Peru) and SAIP (Saudi Arabia). The PPH programmes with ROSPATENT (Russian Federation) and EAPO (Eurasia) have been suspended.

OJ EPO 2022, A44 OJ EPO 2022, A45 OJ EPO 2022, A58 OJ EPO 2022, A595. Accelerated processing of oppositions

In cases where an infringement action in respect of a European patent is pending before the Unified Patent Court or a national court of a contracting state, a party to the opposition proceedings may request accelerated processing. The request may be filed at any time. It must be filed in written reasoned form. In addition, the EPO will also accelerate the processing of the opposition if it is informed by the Unified Patent Court, the national court or the competent authority of a contracting state that infringement or revocation actions are pending (D‑VII, 1.2 and OJ EPO 2023, A99).6. Accelerated processing before the boards of appeal

Parties with a legitimate interest may ask the boards of appeal to deal with their appeals rapidly. This option is also available to the courts and competent authorities of the contracting states (see Art. 10 Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal, OJ EPO 2019, A63, as amended by OJ EPO 2021, A19).7. Enquiries

In specific cases, parties to proceedings before the EPO may have an interest in enquiring about the progress of the file and thus obtaining information on when the next Office action is to be expected. A specific procedure for enquiries is available to all parties to proceedings before the EPO's departments of first instance, and applies to enquiries filed on or after 1 November 2016 (see the notice from the EPO dated 2 August 2016, OJ EPO 2016, A66).

Under this procedure, an enquiry is processed and replied to only if it is filed online using EPO Form 1012. It may be submitted for only one application or patent at a time. The EPO will promptly issue an acknowledgement of receipt. Both the enquiries and the replies from the EPO form integral parts of the file and, as such, are open to file inspection.

Specific parameters may have an impact on the handling time for enquiries. For example, the non-payment of the renewal fee by the due date under Rule 51(1) may delay the EPO's handling of an enquiry.

In general, the EPO will reply to enquiries by indicating the period within which the next Office action may be expected, taking into account the workload in the technical area concerned and the internal deadline for the completion of the pending action.

Nevertheless, in the following cases an enquiry will automatically cause the EPO to issue the next action within one month from receipt of the enquiry:

– where the extended/partial European search report in respect of European patent applications filed on or after 1 June 2014 (including international applications entering the European phase where the EPO did not act as (S)ISA) has not been issued within six months from the filing date or from expiry of the period under Rule 161(2); or

– where an Office action in respect of an application which is being processed under the PACE programme or for which a previous enquiry has been made has not been performed within the committed period;

and within six months from receipt of the enquiry:

– where the extended/partial European search report in respect of European patent applications (including PCT applications entering the European phase where the EPO did not act as (S)ISA) filed before 1 June 2014 and which do claim priority (second filings) has not been issued.

Unlike the PACE programme, the filing of enquiries does not imply a general acceleration of the prosecution of European patent applications. Prosecution of the application can be accelerated by separately requesting application of the PACE programme (see E‑VIII, 4).8. Renunciation of rights

8.1 Withdrawal of application or designation

8.2 Withdrawal of priority claim

8.3 Statement of withdrawal

8.4 Surrender of patent8.1 Withdrawal of application or designation

Applicants may withdraw their application at any time as long as the application is pending, provided that no third parties have proven to the EPO that they have initiated proceedings concerning entitlement to the application pursuant to Rule 14. With regard to the pendency of an application, see A‑IV, 1.1.1.

Rule 15

The same applies to the withdrawal of a designation (see also A‑III, 11.3.8). If all designations are withdrawn, the application is deemed to be withdrawn.

Art. 79(3) Rule 39(2) and Rule 39(3)

Withdrawal of the application in due time before the eighteen-month publication has the advantage that the contents of the application do not become known to the public (see A‑VI, 1.2). If, furthermore, no rights have been left outstanding and the application has not served as a basis for claiming a right of priority, a subsequent application for the same invention can be considered as the first application for the purposes of determining priority (see F‑VI, 1.4.1). If the examination fee has been paid, it will be refunded in full or in part (see A‑VI, 2.5).

Where a patent application has been refused, proceedings are still pending until expiry of the period for filing an appeal. On the day after, proceedings are no longer pending if no appeal is filed. Therefore, an application which is refused either in written or oral proceedings can still be withdrawn in this period.

Art. 87(4)8.2 Withdrawal of priority claim

The priority claim may also be withdrawn (see F‑VI, 3.5). If this is done before the technical preparations for publication of the application are completed, the publication will be deferred until eighteen months after the date of filing of the European application or, where multiple priorities are claimed, the earliest priority date remaining (see A‑VI, 1.1 and A‑III, 6.3).8.3 Statement of withdrawal

Any statement of withdrawal must be unqualified and unambiguous. It may, however, be conditional upon, e.g. avoidance of publication or refund of the examination fee. An unqualified and unambiguous withdrawal becomes effective the day it has been received by the EPO.

If such a statement of withdrawal is made orally during oral proceedings, then either a (handwritten) signed confirmation is to be submitted during the proceedings or the division has to confirm the withdrawal in the minutes and read out the corresponding passage for confirmation in the oral proceedings. The withdrawal has effect from the date of the oral proceedings.8.4 Surrender of patent

A patent may not be surrendered in opposition proceedings by the proprietor filing a declaration of surrender with the EPO. Such a surrender must be declared before the competent authorities in the designated states in question (see D‑VII, 5.1). Nevertheless, if a proprietor unambiguously declares to the EPO the surrender (or abandonment or renunciation) of the patent, this is deemed equivalent to a request that the patent be revoked (see also D‑VIII, 1.2.5).

Rule 84(1)Chapter IX – Applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)

1. General remarks

2. EPO as designated or elected Office

3. The communication according to Rule 161

4. Examination procedure1. General remarks

The EPO may be a "designated Office" or an "elected Office" for an international application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) designating "EP" (Euro-PCT application). If an applicant enters the European phase without having requested international preliminary examination under PCT Chapter II, the EPO will act as a "designated Office". If before entering the European phase the application was processed under PCT Chapter II, the EPO will act in the European phase as an ''elected Office''. Pursuant to Art. 153(2), an international application for which the EPO is a designated or elected Office is deemed to be a European patent application.

Art. 153(1)(a) and Art. 153(1)(b) Art. 153(2) Art. 150(2)

In addition to being a designated and, where appropriate, elected Office, the EPO may act as a receiving Office under the PCT within the terms set out in Art. 151. It may also act as an International Searching Authority (ISA), as an International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) under the terms of Art. 152 and/or as an International Searching Authority specified for Supplementary International Search (SISA) under the PCT (see also the EPO-WIPO Agreement, OJ EPO 2017, A115, OJ EPO 2018, A24, and OJ EPO 2018, A35). There are thus the following possibilities for a European application filed under the provisions of the PCT:

(i)the filing of the application and the international search take place at an office or offices other than the EPO (e.g. the Japan Patent Office). The EPO is a designated Office;

(ii)the application is filed at another office (e.g. the United Kingdom Patent Office) but the EPO performs the international search. The EPO acts as International Searching Authority and is a designated Office;

(iii)the application is filed at the EPO, which also performs the international search. The EPO acts as receiving Office, International Searching Authority and designated Office;

(iv)in the cases mentioned under (i) - (iii), the applicant files, in addition, a demand for international preliminary examination with an IPEA other than the EPO. The EPO is an "elected Office";

(v)in the cases mentioned under (i) - (iii), the applicant files, in addition, a demand for international preliminary examination with the EPO as International Preliminary Examining Authority. The EPO may carry out this function irrespective of whether it was the receiving Office. It can, however, only act as an IPEA if the international search was carried out by the EPO, the Austrian, Spanish, Swedish, Finnish or Turkish Patent Office, the Nordic Patent Institute or the Visegrad Patent Institute. The EPO thus acts as IPEA and is also an elected Office;

(vi)if the international search has been carried out by an office other than the EPO, the applicant may still request the EPO to perform a supplementary international search (SIS) in its capacity as SISA.

In case (i), there will be an international search report drawn up by another office. In cases (ii) and (iii), the international search report and the "written opinion of the International Searching Authority" (WO‑ISA) (Rule 43bis PCT) will have been prepared by the search division of the EPO.

For further details on the procedure before the EPO as RO, ISA, IPEA or SISA, see the Guidelines for search and examination at the EPO as PCT authority (GL/﻿PCT‑EPO) and the Guide for applicants: "'Euro-PCT Guide': PCT procedure at the EPO".

Art. 151 Art. 152 Rule 157 Rule 1582. EPO as designated or elected Office

In proceedings before the EPO relating to international applications, the provisions of the PCT apply, supplemented by the provisions of the EPC. In case of conflict, the provisions of the PCT prevail. The EPO cannot require compliance with requirements relating to form or contents of the international application different from or additional to those which are provided for in the PCT.

As a result of the prevalence of the PCT provisions and the requirements of Art. 150 and Art. 153 relating to international applications under the PCT in the European phase, the instructions in the earlier chapters of these Guidelines do not always apply to the procedure before the EPO as designated or elected Office.

This section deals with the specific aspects of the procedure before the EPO as designated or elected Office. It addresses, in subsections E‑IX, 2.2 to 2.5 and 2.10, the formalities examination of international applications upon entry into the European phase in so far as it differs from that applicable to European direct applications, by reference to the instructions in the appropriate sections of Part A.

2.1.4 Filing fee, designation fee, request for examination and search fee2.1.1 Requirements for entry into the European phase

"Entry into the European phase" is not an act in itself but a series of acts to be performed. In order to initiate the European phase, the applicant must perform the following acts within 31 months from the filing date or, if priority has been claimed, from the earliest priority date:

– supply the translation if the Euro-PCT application was not published in one of the EPO's official languages (see E‑IX, 2.1.3),

– specify the application documents on which the European grant procedure is to be based,

– pay the filing fee provided for in Art. 78(2), including the additional page fee for applications with more than 35 pages (see E‑IX, 2.1.4),

– pay the designation fee (and any extension or validation fees) if the period under Rule 39 has expired earlier (see E‑IX, 2.3.11),

– pay the search fee if a supplementary European search report is to be drawn up (see E‑IX, 2.1.4 and E‑IX, 2.5.3),

– file the request for examination and pay the examination fee if the period under Rule 70(1) has expired earlier (see E‑IX, 2.1.4),

– pay the renewal fee for the third year if the period under Rule 51(1) has expired earlier (see E‑IX, 2.3.12),

– where applicable, file the certificate of exhibition mentioned in Art. 55(2) (see E‑IX, 2.4.3).

Depending on the circumstances of the particular application, the applicant may additionally have to complete one or more of the following acts within the 31-month time limit:

– pay any claims fees due (see E‑IX, 2.3.8),

– file the designation of the inventor (see E‑IX, 2.3.4),

– furnish the file number or the certified copy of the application(s) of which priority is claimed (see E‑IX, 2.3.5),

– furnish a sequence listing complying with the standard (see E‑IX, 2.4.2),

– furnish the indications on the applicant mentioned in Rule 163(4) in respect of any applicant (see E‑IX, 2.3.1),

– appoint a professional representative (see E‑IX, 2.3.1),

– furnish a copy of the results of any search carried out by or on behalf of the authority with which the priority application was filed (see A‑III, 6.12).

Applicants are strongly recommended to use the most recent edition of Form 1200 available as editable electronic document from the EPO website (epo.org), as part of the Online Filing software or as part of the new online filing (CMS). For further details on the available filing methods see A‑VIII, 2.5. The form and any other documents must be filed with the EPO, they may not be sent to the IB or to an authority of an EPC contracting state.

Rule 159

The documents on which the proceedings in the European phase are to be based can best be indicated in section 6 of Form 1200; further details may be provided on an additional sheet. The applicant must make sure that the indications in section 6 and/or on the additional sheet correspond to any indications given in the table for section 6 provided for the calculation of the additional (page) fee to be paid for applications comprising more than 35 pages (see A‑III, 13.2). If the applicant has filed test reports (e.g. comparative examples in support of inventive step) with the EPO as IPEA, it is assumed that the EPO may also use them in the European grant proceedings.

If the applicant does not specify the application documents on which the European grant procedure is to be based, the international application as published as well as any amendments made in the international phase are considered to form part of the procedure. The additional fee to be paid for an application comprising more than thirty-five pages will be calculated on the basis of the international application as published; any amendment pages not specified as replacing the corresponding pages of the international publication will be taken as additional pages (see A‑III, 13.2).

Rule 159(1)(b)2.1.2 Initial processing and formal examination; copy of the international application

The initial processing and formal examination of international applications are carried out in the international phase by PCT authorities under the PCT.

Unless there is a specific request for early processing (see E‑IX, 2.8), the EPO acting as a designated or elected Office may not process or examine an international application prior to the expiry of 31 months from the date of filing of the application or, if priority has been claimed, from the earliest priority date (31-month time limit). The EPO will, however, prior to the expiry of the 31-month time limit, perform any purely administrative tasks such as adding documents relating to the European phase to the file and recording the professional European representative appointed to act on behalf of the applicant in the European phase, to ensure the correct notification of correspondence once the ban on processing has been lifted. Since the EPO has not exercised the waiver referred to in Art. 20(1)(a) PCT, a copy of the international application will be furnished by the International Bureau. The EPO does not require the applicant to furnish a copy of the international application under Art. 22 PCT or Art. 39 PCT, even if the International Bureau has not yet communicated a copy under Art. 20 PCT at the time the application enters the European phase (see PCT Gazette 14/1986, 2367).

Where the international application was not published in an official language of the EPO, the applicant is required, in accordance with Art. 22 PCT or Art. 39 PCT and Rule 159(1)(a), to furnish a translation of the published application within a period of 31 months from the date of filing or, if priority has been claimed, from the earliest priority date (31-month time limit). The language of the translation determines the language of the proceedings before the EPO.

The translation must include:

Rules 12.1(d) PCT and Rule 49.5(a-bis) PCT

(vii)any references to deposited biological material furnished separately,

Rule 49.3 PCT and Rule 49.5(h) PCT

(viii)if the EPO acts as designated Office, and the applicant wishes the amended claims under Art. 19 PCT to form the basis of further proceedings,

– the amendments under Art. 19 PCT in the form of a translation of the complete set of claims furnished under that provision and the statement under Art. 19(1) PCT, if submitted to the IB, and,

– the accompanying letter, indicating the basis for the amendments in the application as filed (Rule 46.5(b) PCT), so as to allow the examiner to understand and take the amendments into account (see also E‑IX, 3.4),

Art. 19 PCT Rule 49.3 PCT, Rule 49.5(a)(ii) PCT and Rule 49.5(c-bis) PCT Rules 3 and 137(4)

(ix)if the EPO acts as elected Office,

– all annexes to the international preliminary examination report (IPER), i.e. any replacement sheets and accompanying letters referred to in Rule 70.16 PCT that allow the examiner to understand the amendments, regardless of whether protection is sought for the same version of the application documents as was the subject of the IPER,

Art. 39(1) PCT, Art. 36(2)(b) PCT and Art. 36(3)(b) PCT Rules 70.16 PCT and Rules 74.1(a) PCT

– any amendments made to the claims under Art. 19 PCT (cf. item (viii) above) if the applicant wishes these amendments to form the basis of further proceedings and they are not annexed to the IPER (for instance because they were considered reversed by an amendment under Art. 34 PCT).

Rule 76.5(iv) PCT

If the applicant does not furnish the translation of any of the items (i) or (ii) above within the 31-month period, the application is deemed to be withdrawn under Rule 160(1).

Where the application is deemed to be withdrawn under Rule 160(1), Rule 112(2) applies mutatis mutandis. The loss of rights is deemed not to have occurred if, within two months as from notification of the communication, the translation and a valid request for further processing (including the payment of the requisite fee) are filed (Art. 121 and Rule 135(1), see E‑VIII, 2).

Where an international application was filed and published in the international phase in an official language of the EPO, it is not possible to change the language of the proceedings on entry into the European phase by filing a translation of that application into either of the other two official languages of the EPO (see G 4/08). In such cases, the language of the proceedings within the meaning of Art. 14(3) remains the language in which the application was published by WIPO's International Bureau.

Rule 49.5(c) PCT Rule 3(1)

A translation, whether filed on entry into the European phase under Art. 153(4) or in the international phase under Rule 12.3 or 12.4 PCT, may always be brought into conformity with the application as filed. The conditions set out in A‑VII, 7 apply.

Art. 153(4) Art. 14(2)2.1.4 Filing fee, designation fee, request for examination and search fee

Under Rule 159(1)(c), applicants must pay the filing fee, including any additional fee for pages in excess of thirty-five (see A‑III, 13.2), within a period of 31 months from the date of filing or, if priority has been claimed, from the earliest priority date. Further, under Rule 159(1)(d), they must pay the designation fee within this period, if the time limit specified in Rule 39(1) has expired earlier. Under Rule 159(1)(f), the request for examination must also be filed within this period, if the time limit specified in Rule 70(1) has expired earlier (see also E‑IX, 2.5.2). Where a supplementary European search report needs to be drawn up, a search fee must also be paid to the EPO within this period (see also E‑IX, 2.5.3). Failure to pay in due time the filing fee, the additional fee, the search fee, the designation fee or the examination fee, or to file the request for examination, means that the application is deemed to be withdrawn.

If the EPO finds that the application is deemed to be withdrawn for this reason, it communicates this to the applicant (Rule 160(2)).

The communication under Rule 160(2) and the communication according to Rule 112(1) are sent together in one and the same communication. In response to this notification of a loss of rights, the applicant can request further processing (see E‑VIII, 2).

Rule 159(1) Rule 160 Art. 2(1), item 12, RFees2.2 Instructions in Chapter A‑II ("Filing of applications and examination on filing")

The instructions in A‑II, 1 ("Where and how applications may be filed") do not apply to international applications, except where explicit reference is made to international applications, including Euro-PCT applications.

The PCT requirements corresponding to those of A‑II, 2 ("Persons entitled to file an application") are more restrictive, as in general the applicant must be a resident or national of a PCT contracting state and therefore no further examination as regards entitlement is necessary.

The instructions in A‑II, 3 ("Procedure on filing") do not apply.

The provisions for late filing of missing parts (Rule 56) or correction of erroneously filed application documents or parts (Rule 56a) completely contained in the priority document apply if the EPO is designated/elected Office. Similar options exist under the PCT in relation to the receiving Office (Rule 20.5 PCT to Rule 20.8 PCT). These sets of provisions apply in parallel. For a request under Rule 56 or Rule 56a to be allowed by the EPO as designated/elected Office, it must have been filed, together with the documents required under Rule 56(3) or Rule 56a(4) respectively, within two months from the date of filing or from a communication of the receiving Office under Rule 20.5(a) PCT or Rule 20.5bis(a) PCT, as the case may be (see Rule 56(2) and Rule 56a(3)), and the applicant must have effectively requested "early processing" under Art. 23(2) PCT (see E‑IX, 2.8) before expiry of the two-month period under Rule 56(2) or Rule 56a(3).

Incorporations by reference by the receiving Office under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT, i.e. without changing the filing date, will be effective before the EPO as designated or elected Office for international applications filed on or after 1 November 2022 (see C‑III, 1.3). For details see the notice from the EPO dated 23 June 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A71. On entry into the European phase, the normal procedures apply on the basis that the correct and erroneously filed parts are thus considered part of the application as filed.

Rule 56 Rule 56a Rule 20 PCT

In addition, Art. 26 PCT, Art. 27 PCT and Art. 48 PCT, Rules 82bis PCT and Rule 82ter PCT and Rule 139 EPC apply.

The date of filing (see A‑II, 4 ("Examination on filing")) of a Euro-PCT application is that accorded under the PCT by the PCT authority which acted as the receiving Office unless correction as a consequence of review by the EPO as designated/elected Office under Art. 24 PCT or Art. 25 PCT or Rule 82ter PCT applies (see E‑IX, 2.9). In respect of the procedure for establishing the date of filing in the case of elements or parts erroneously filed under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT, see C‑III, 1.3. The formalities examination upon entry into the European phase encompasses all checks required to verify that the requirements of Rules 159 and Rule 163 have been met.

If the application is not deemed to be withdrawn, a copy of the application is referred to the search division for drawing up any supplementary European search report, if necessary (see E‑IX, 3.1).

2.3.12 Renewal fees2.3.1 Representation, address for correspondence

The instructions in A‑III, 2 ("Representation") apply to international applications whether furnished in an official language or in translation. An agent having a right to practise before the PCT International Authorities is not necessarily authorised to act before the EPO (see Art. 27(7) PCT).

If the agents acting in the international phase are professional representatives entitled to practise before the EPO, such representatives are not automatically considered appointed for the European phase. If any applicant has mandated them to act on their behalf also in the European phase, the representatives need to identify themselves accordingly to the EPO as designated/elected Office. The only case in which professional representatives acting in the international phase are automatically considered appointed for the European phase is if they were validly appointed in the procedure before the EPO as receiving Office, ISA or IPEA and it is clear from the respective file that the appointment extends to representation in the European phase. The same principles apply where applicants having their residence or principal place of business in an EPC contracting state are represented by an authorised employee (see A‑VIII, 1.3).

Applicants, in particular those not resident in an EPC contracting state, are recommended to appoint a professional representative before the EPO in good time, i.e. before initiating proceedings before the EPO as designated/elected Office (see also E‑IX, 2.1.2).

However, up to expiry of the 31-month time limit under Rule 159, applicants having neither a residence nor their principal place of business within the territory of one of the contracting states may either comply with any requirement themselves or act through a professional representative entitled to practise before the EPO. This means that applicants having neither a residence nor the principal place of business within the territory of one of the contracting states may themselves , within the 31-month time limit, for example sign and file EPO Form 1200, submit amendments, file a translation of the application, file a request for early processing, etc.

Applicants having neither a residence nor their principal place of business within the territory of one of the contracting states who do not themselves take the required steps for entry into the European phase within the 31-month time limit may, after expiry of that time limit, perform these and the other procedural steps (e.g. filing a request for re-establishment of rights) only through a professional representative entitled to practise before the EPO.

In case of failure to appoint a professional representative where this is required, the EPO invites the applicant to do so within a time limit of two months. Until the EPO is informed of a (valid) appointment, any procedural step taken by the applicant will be deemed not to have been taken. If the deficiency is not corrected in due time, the application will be refused; the applicant may request further processing (see E‑VIII, 2).

Rule 163(5) - Rules 163(6)

If there is more than one applicant and the following information was not provided for one or more of those applicants in the international phase and is still missing at the expiry of the 31-month time limit under Rule 159(1):

(i)address

(ii)nationality

(iii)state of residence or principal place of business

the EPO will invite the applicant to furnish these indications within two months. Failure to do so will lead to refusal of the application. The same applies if the requirements for representation are not met at the end of the 31-month time limit, with the same consequence for failure to correct the deficiency in time. If the applicants fail to reply in time to the above-mentioned invitation, they may request further processing.

Applicants (whether natural or legal persons) whose residence or principal place of business is in an EPC contracting state and who act without a professional representative may make use of an address for correspondence which is different from their address of residence. See A‑III, 4.2.1.

Rule 163(4) - Rules 163(6)2.3.2 Physical requirements

Although compliance of an international application with the PCT requirements as to form and content is, as a rule, ascertained during the international phase, the EPO may check Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase for compliance with Rule 11 PCT. If the application documents do not comply with this provision, the EPO will issue a communication indicating any deficiencies and invite the applicant to correct them within a time limit of two months under Rule 58.

Since the translation filed under Rule 159(1)(a) is filed for the procedure before the EPO as designated or elected Office, the translation must comply with the physical requirements as set out in A‑III, 3 ("Physical requirements"). The requirements are in general identical with the corresponding requirements of the PCT.2.3.3 Request for grant

The PCT request corresponds in general to the EPO request for grant form (EPO Form 1001) and provides for the entry of the information listed in Rule 41(2), with the exception of the items referred to in sub-paragraphs (e) and (f) thereof.2.3.4 Designation of inventor

The requirement, as set out in A‑III, 5 ("Designation of inventor"), that the designation of inventor is filed in a separate document where the applicant is not the inventor or the sole inventor has to be complied with irrespective of the language of the international application unless the inventor has already been named in the PCT request. Where an inventor has been named in the PCT request, the latter cannot waive their right to be mentioned in the published application. If the inventor has not been named in the international application at the expiry of the period of 31 months from the date of filing, or, in the case of priority, from the earliest date of priority claimed (31-month time limit), the EPO invites the applicant to file the designation of inventor within a period of two months. Failure to rectify this deficiency in time, leads to refusal of the application according to Rule 163(6). Applicants will be notified of this decision according to Rule 111. They may request further processing (see E‑VIII, 2).

Rule 163(1)2.3.5 Claim to priority

The claim to priority (see A‑III, 6 ("Claim to priority")) for an international application refers to the date, or dates, claimed under the PCT.

Rule 17.1 PCT and Rule 17.2 PCT

2.3.5.1 Priority document

2.3.5.2 Information on prior art

2.3.5.3 Restoration of priority2.3.5.1 Priority document

Normally, the copy of the previous application, referred to in A‑III, 6.7, i.e. the priority document, is furnished to the EPO as designated Office by the International Bureau and not by the applicant. In accordance with Rule 17.2 PCT, the International Bureau will be requested by the EPO to furnish it with a copy as standard practice promptly, but not earlier than international publication, or, where the applicant has requested early processing (in accordance with Art. 23(2) PCT), not earlier than the date of the request. Where the applicant has complied with Rule 17.1(a) PCT, Rule 17.1(b) PCT or Rule 17.1(b-bis) PCT, the EPO may not ask the applicant himself to furnish a copy.

Where the file number or the copy of the previous application has not yet been submitted at the expiry of the 31-month time limit, the EPO invites the applicant to furnish the number or the copy within two months. However, Rule 53(2) and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 18 October 2018, OJ EPO 2018, A78, providing an exception to the requirement that a copy of the previous application be furnished (see A‑III, 6.7), also apply to international applications entering the European phase. Furthermore, where the applicant has complied with Rule 17.1(a) PCT, Rule 17.1(b) PCT or Rule 17.1(b-bis) PCT the EPO as a designated Office may not ask the applicant himself to furnish it with a copy of the priority document (Rule 17.2(a) PCT, second sentence).

If the priority document is not on file, substantive examination may nevertheless be started, provided that neither intermediate documents (published in the priority period) nor Art. 54(3) documents exist which cause the patentability of the subject-matter claimed to depend on the validity of the priority right. However, no European patent may be granted until such time as the priority document is on file. In such a case, the applicant is informed that the decision to grant will not be taken as long as the priority document is missing.

On the other hand, the application may be refused without the priority document being on file, provided that the relevant prior art is neither an intermediate document nor an Art. 54(3) document, the relevance of which depends on the validity of the priority right. For more details on treatment of such cases in examination see F‑VI, 3.4.

Rule 163(2)

Where a translation of the previous application into one of the official languages of the EPO is required, it must be filed on request from the EPO in accordance with Rule 53(3) (see A‑III, 6.8 and subsections and A-III, 6.10).

Art. 88(1) Rule 53(3)2.3.5.2 Information on prior art

The applicant must, on entry into the European phase, file the results of any search carried out by or on behalf of the office of first filing for each application whose priority is claimed (see A‑III, 6.12).2.3.5.3 Restoration of priority

The provisions for restoration of priority right (see A‑III, 6.6) also exist under the PCT (Rules 26bis.3 PCT and Rule 49ter PCT). Under the PCT, restoration of the right of priority can be made either in the international phase before the receiving Office (Rule 26bis.3 PCT) or upon entry into the European phase before the EPO as designated or elected Office (Rule 49ter.2(b)(i) PCT).

The EPO only applies the "due care" criterion in accordance with its practice under Art. 122 (Rules 26bis.3(a)(i) PCT and Rule 49ter.2(a)(i) PCT; see also E‑VIII, 3.2 and the notice from the EPO dated 7 November 2007, OJ EPO 2007, 692). As a consequence, any request for restoration of priority rights granted by a receiving Office under the "unintentional" criterion does not have any effect before the EPO as designated/elected Office (Rule 49ter.1(b) PCT).

As set out hereafter, if the applicant has already filed a request for restoration of priority with the receiving Office, a (new) request need not always be filed upon entry into the European phase.

If the priority right was restored by the receiving Office under the "due care criterion", no new request need be filed with the EPO as designated/elected Office, since the EPO will, in principle, recognise the decision of the receiving Office. If, however, the EPO has reasonable doubt that the requirements for grant were met, it will notify the applicant accordingly. In this communication the reasons for such doubt will be indicated and a time limit will be set within which the applicant may submit comments.

Consequently, if the applicant wants the priority claim to be valid in the procedure before the EPO as designated/elected Office, a request for restoration must always be filed if, in the procedure before the receiving Office:

– no request for restoration of priority right was filed;

– a request for restoration of priority right was rejected;

– a request for restoration of priority right was granted under the "unintentional criterion".

The EPO as designated/elected Office will grant a request for restoration of priority right only if the following requirements are met:

(i)the filing date is within two months of the date of expiry of the priority period;

(ii)the failure to claim the right of priority within the priority period occurred in spite of due care required by the circumstances having been taken;

(iii)a request for restoration of priority is filed within one month from the date on which the 31-month time limit for entry into the European phase expired or from the effective date of early entry into the European phase (see E‑IX, 2.8); where the application is deemed withdrawn under Rule 160(1) for failure to comply with a requirement under Rule 159(1), the request for restoration of priority may still be filed together with a timely request for further processing in respect of the 31-month time limit under Rule 159(1) or, failing this, with a timely request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the period for requesting further processing;

(iv)the fee for restoration of priority (Art. 2(1), item 13, RFees) is duly paid within the time limit mentioned under point (iii); the further considerations made under point (iii) also apply to this fee;

(v)the request is accompanied by a statement of reasons for the failure to file the international application within the priority period and is preferably accompanied by any declaration or other evidence in support of the statement of reasons.

Rule 49ter PCT Art. 122 PCT Newsletter 9/2015, 102.3.6 Title of the invention

In relation to A‑III, 7 ("Title of the invention"), the title need only meet the less demanding requirements of Rule 4.3 PCT rather than those set out in A‑III, 7.1 and A-III, 7.2.2.3.7 Prohibited matter

As prohibited statements or matter may not necessarily be omitted under Art. 21(6) PCT, the application must be examined to ensure that the instructions in A‑III, 8 ("Prohibited matter") are complied with. Where the EPO is informed by the International Bureau that statements or matter were omitted from the published PCT application, the Receiving Section has to ensure that the corresponding material is excluded from the translation as furnished by the applicant (see E‑IX, 2.1.3).2.3.8 Claims fee

The time limit for paying the claims fee referred to in A‑III, 9 is 31 months from the date of filing or, if priority has been claimed, from the earliest priority date (Rule 162(1)).

If they have not been paid by then, under Rule 162(2), they may still be paid within the six-month period under Rule 161(1) and (2). Rule 162(2) distinguishes between two situations in which the applicant must ensure payment of claims fees before expiry of the six-month period:

Rule 162(2), first sentence, covers the situation in which the applicant does not file amendments after expiry of the 31-month period and before expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161. In this case, the applicant must ensure that any claims fees not yet paid for the set of claims filed within the 31-month period are paid before expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161.

Example:

A Euro-PCT application X contains 27 claims on expiry of the 31-month period. The applicants pay five claims fees within the 31-month period. They must ensure that seven claims fees are paid before expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161.

Rule 162(2), second sentence, covers the situation in which the applicants file an amended set of claims after expiry of the 31-month period and before expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161. In this case, they must compute the number of claims fees due on the basis of the claims on file on expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161. Before expiry of this period, they must ensure that any claims fees are paid for the number of claims on file on expiry of this period which exceeds the number of claims for which claims fees were paid within the 31-month period.

Example:

A Euro-PCT application Y contains 27 claims on expiry of the 31-month period. The applicants pay five claims fees within the 31-month period. After expiry of the 31-month period and before expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161, they file an amended set of 32 claims. The applicants must compute the number of claims fees on the basis of the claims on file on expiry of the six-month period, i.e. 32 - 15 = 17. Since they have already paid five claims fees, they must pay 12 claims fees (17 - 5 = 12) before expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161.

If there are more than 15 claims on file on expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161, any of the sixteenth and each subsequent claim for which no claims fee has been paid is deemed to be abandoned under Rule 162(4) (see also the notice from the EPO dated 16 December 2016, OJ EPO 2016, A103).

Where a claims fee is not paid in due time, the claim concerned shall be deemed to be abandoned. The loss of rights may be remedied by a request for further processing (see E‑VIII, 2). Features of a claim deemed to have been abandoned pursuant to Rule 162(4) and which are not otherwise to be found in the description or drawings cannot subsequently be reintroduced into the application and, in particular, into the claims.

Rule 162(2)2.3.9 Drawings

The provisions of the EPC concerning the filing of drawings (see A‑II, 5 and A‑III, 3.2) are identical with the corresponding provisions of the PCT and therefore no supplementary examination is necessary, provided that the provisions of Rule 11 PCT have been complied with (see also E‑IX, 2.3.2).2.3.10 Abstract

The abstract (see A‑III, 10 ("Abstract")) is included in the copy of the international application supplied to the EPO.2.3.11 Designation fee

The time limit for paying the designation fee is 31 months from the date of filing or, if priority has been claimed, from the earliest priority date (31-month time limit), if the time limit specified in Rule 39(1) has expired earlier (Rule 159(1)(d)) (see A‑III, 11.2.5 for further details). If, subsequent to the receipt of the international application by the EPO and prior to the date on which processing or examination may start, the regional designation of all contracting states of the EPC is withdrawn, the Euro-PCT application, in so far as it is deemed to be a European application pursuant to Art. 153(2) and Art. 11(3) PCT, is deemed to be withdrawn.

For information on the requirements for extension or validation of a Euro-PCT application to states for which an Extension Agreement or a Validation Agreement with the EPO has become effective, see A‑III, 12.2.3.12 Renewal fees

The renewal fees for a Euro-PCT application are due in respect of the third and each subsequent year, calculated from the date of filing of the Euro-PCT application as accorded by the receiving Office. If, according to Rule 51(1), the renewal fee for the third year fell due within the 31-month time limit for entry into the European phase, the due date is deferred and the fee may still be paid without surcharge up to expiry of the 31-month time limit (see A‑X, 5.2.4).

Rule 159(1)(g)2.4 Instructions in Chapter A‑IV ("Special provisions")

2.4.1 Divisional applications

2.4.2 Sequence listings

2.4.3 Certificate of exhibition

2.4.4 Biological material2.4.1 Divisional applications

In relation to A‑IV, 1 ("European divisional applications") there is no provision in the PCT for filing divisional applications. One or more European divisional applications may be filed in respect of subject-matter contained in a pending Euro-PCT application, but not before the latter application has entered the European phase (see A‑IV, 1.1), i.e. not before the time limit under Rule 159(1) (in conjunction with Art. 22(1) PCT and Art. 22(3) PCT) has expired (see G 1/09, Reasons 3.2.5), and on condition that any requirement of Art. 22(1) PCT which must be fulfilled within that time limit for the application concerned is met (see J 18/09). Furthermore, divisional applications may be filed as from the date the applicant has filed an effective request for early processing (see J 18/09, Reasons 9, and E‑IX, 2.8).

The requirements of Rule 36 for filing divisionals must be complied with (see A‑IV, 1). The divisional application must be filed in the language specified in Rule 36(2) (see A‑IV, 1.3.3). In order to avoid that the Euro-PCT application is deemed withdrawn at the time a divisional application is filed, the respective requirements of Rule 159(1) must be fulfilled within the relevant time limits (see also E‑IX, 2.1.2, E‑IX, 2.1.3 and E‑IX, 2.1.4).2.4.2 Sequence listings

In relation to A‑IV, 5 ("Applications relating to nucleotide and amino acid sequences"), where the Euro-PCT application discloses nucleotide or amino acid sequences, a sequence listing in electronic form drawn up in compliance with the applicable WIPO standard must be available to the EPO as designated/elected Office on expiry of the 31-month time limit. As a rule, it will be available to the EPO if it was contained in the international application under Rule 5.2 PCT or filed under Rule 13ter PCT with the EPO acting as ISA/SISA or IPEA. It will also be accessible to the EPO if it is made available by WIPO on PATENTSCOPE and can be downloaded in a usable form.

If such a sequence listing is not available to the EPO and has not been filed by the applicant, at the expiry of the 31-month time limit, the applicant will be invited to furnish the sequence listing in electronic form in accordance with the applicable WIPO standard and pay a late-furnishing fee within a period of two months (see Rule 163(3) and Rule 30(3)). The sequence listing may not be filed on paper or in PDF format (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 December 2021 (OJ EPO 2021, A96) and point 6 of the notice from the EPO dated 9 December 2021 (OJ EPO 2021, A97).

If the required sequence listing is not filed within the time limit set, the application is refused. The refusal may be remedied by a request for further processing (see E‑VIII, 2).

Rule 163(3)2.4.3 Certificate of exhibition

As regards the requirements described in A‑IV, 3 ("Display at an exhibition"), for Euro-PCT applications the certificate of exhibition, where relevant, is to be filed within the 31-month time limit for entry into the European phase. If the document is not filed in due time, the applicant is informed of this in a communication under Rule 112(1). The omission may be remedied by a request for further processing, which will be granted if within two months from notification of the communication the certificate is furnished and the fee for further processing is paid (see E‑VIII, 2).

Rule 159(1)(h)2.4.4 Biological material

With respect to A‑IV, 4 ("Applications relating to biological material"), no remedy is available before the EPO as designated/elected Office upon entry into the European phase if the specific requirements for the sufficient disclosure of the invention have not been met in the international phase. If, however, on filing the international application a reference to the deposit of biological material complying with Rule 31 was made but no proof of the deposit in the form of a copy of the deposit receipt issued by the depositary institution was submitted, the applicant is strongly advised to do so upon entry into the European phase. See also F‑III, 6.5.

If the Euro-PCT application was not published by the IB in an official language of the EPO, the biological material referred to in the application is available upon request to any person (only) from the date of publication of the translation by the EPO (see E‑IX, 2.5.1). In this case, if the applicant files the statement under Rule 32(1) before the technical preparations for publication of the translation by the EPO are completed, the biological material concerned will be made available only by the issue of a sample to an independent expert nominated by the requester (see A‑IV, 4.3).

Rule 312.5 Instructions in Chapter A‑VI ("Publication of application; request for examination and transmission of the dossier to examining division")

2.5.1 Publication of the international application

2.5.2 Request for examination

2.5.3 Supplementary European search2.5.1 Publication of the international application

The international publication of a Euro-PCT application in an official language of the European Patent Office takes the place of publication of the European patent application and will be mentioned in the European Patent Bulletin. If the international publication of the Euro-PCT application is in another language, a translation into one of the official languages must be filed with the EPO within 31 months of the priority date (Art. 22(1) PCT and Rule 159(1)(a)), see E‑IX, 2.1.3. The EPO will publish the translation of the application submitted by the applicant upon entry into the European phase. In that case the provisional protection is, subject to Art. 67(2) and (3), only effective as from the date of publication of the translation by the EPO.

The translation of the international application is published together with the bibliographic data as an A document and includes all documents that were part of the international publication as originally published:

– the description as originally filed;

– the claims as originally filed;

– any claims amended under Art. 19 PCT, including any related statement of which a translation has been filed (see E‑IX, 2.1.3, items (viii) and (ix));

– any drawings as originally filed;

– the sequence listing forming part of the description;

– the abstract;

– any appendices to the application;

– any certificate(s) of the deposit of biological material;

– the translation of the international search report (Rule 44bis.3 PCT).

The mandatory translation of the annexes to the IPER and any amendments to the application documents filed on or after entry into the European phase are not published.

If Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT applies (see C‑III, 1.3), the publication will comprise the translation of both the erroneously filed application documents and the correct application documents. The front page of the publication will make reference to the fact that the notification of incompatibility under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT applies to the application if the application was filed between 1 July 2020 and 31 October 2022. The notification of incompatibility was withdrawn with effect from 1 November 2022 and is no longer indicated for applications filed on or after that date.

Pursuant to Art. 153(6), the international search report takes the place of the European search report. Once the supplementary European search report has been drawn up, this will be mentioned in the European Patent Bulletin. The supplementary search report itself is not published but is available via file inspection (see A‑XI, 2.2).

Art. 153(3) and Art. 153(4) Rule 159 Art. 67

If the translation is not supplied, the application is to be deemed withdrawn (see E‑IX, 2.1.3). Furthermore, in this case, the application which has been published under the PCT is not considered as comprised in the state of the art in accordance with Art. 54(3) pursuant to Rule 165 (see G‑IV, 5.2).

Rule 160(1) Rule 1652.5.2 Request for examination

The time limit under Rule 70(1) for filing the request for examination referred to in A‑VI, 2 runs from the date of publication under Art. 21 PCT of the international search report. However, this time limit will not expire before the time prescribed by Rule 159(1)(f) (31-month time limit). See also E‑IX, 2.1.4.

European substantive examination must normally not begin before expiry of the 31st month from the earliest priority date (Art. 23(1), 40(1) PCT). The only circumstance in which examination may begin earlier is if the applicant has expressly so requested (see E‑IX, 2.8) and if any required supplementary European search report is available.

Art. 153(6) Art. 150(2) Rule 159(1)(f)2.5.3 Supplementary European search

If a supplementary European search report has to be drawn up in respect of an international application which is deemed to be a European patent application, the applicant is entitled to receive the invitation provided for in Rule 70(2) (see A‑VI, 2.2, third paragraph, and J 8/83). A time limit of six months from the notification of this communication is set for filing the confirmation required under Rule 70(2) and for response to the search opinion accompanying the supplementary European search report (Rule 70a(2) and the notice from the EPO dated 15 October 2009, OJ EPO 2009, 533). Applicants making use of Form 1200 for entry into the European phase may waive the right to be asked whether they wish to proceed further by ticking a check box in section 12.2 (see the notice from the EPO dated 7 July 2017, OJ EPO 2017, A74).

Rule 70(2)2.6 Reduction and refunds of fees in respect of international (PCT) applications

See A‑X, 9.3 and A-X, 10.2.2.7 Communication to the EPO as a designated Office

A copy of the application together with the international search report or a declaration in accordance with Art. 17(2)(a) PCT is communicated by the International Bureau to the EPO as a designated Office in accordance with Art. 20(1)(a) PCT; the EPO does not require the applicant to furnish a copy of the international application (Rule 49.1(a-bis) PCT). The EPO as a designated Office will then examine the application for compliance with the requirements of the EPC (see in particular E‑IX, 2.2 and 2.3).

The International Bureau shall communicate the International Preliminary Report on Patentability (Chapter I of the PCT) and any informal comments received from the applicant to the EPO as designated Office at 30 months from the priority date.

Art. 20(1)(a) PCT Rule 44bis.2 PCT2.8 Early processing

When acting as a designated Office, the EPO must not process or examine an international application before expiry of the period applicable under Art. 22 PCT (Art. 23(1) PCT). However, the EPO may, on the express request of the applicant, process or examine an international application at any time (Art. 23(2) PCT). If the International Bureau (IB) has not yet transmitted to the EPO a copy of the international application, the ISR and the WO‑ISA, the applicant may but does not have to file with the IB a request to do so. If necessary, the EPO will take care of this itself.

Art. 23 PCT Rule 44bis.2 PCT

A request for early processing under Art. 23(2) PCT or Art. 40(2) PCT may be filed with the EPO at any time before expiry of the 31-month time limit (Art. 22(3) PCT and Rule 159(1)). The request does not require a specific wording, but applicants must clearly express that they wish the processing of their application before the EPO as designated/elected Office to commence early. Applicants using EPO Form 1200 may file a request by ticking a check box in section 12.1 (see the notice from the EPO dated 7 July 2017, OJ EPO 2017, A74).

Art. 23(2) PCT and Art. 40(2) PCT

For the request to be effective, applicants must comply with the requirements stipulated in Rule 159(1) as if the 31-month time limit expired on the date they request early processing, i.e.: payment of the filing fee (including any additional fee under Art. 2(1), item 1a, RFees if the application comprises more than 35 pages), filing of a translation (if a translation is required under Art. 153(4)), specification of the application documents, and payment of the search fee (where a supplementary European search report has to be drawn up under Art. 153(7)). Which further requirements stipulated in Rule 159(1) must be complied with depends on the date on which early processing is requested, since the (regular) time limits for paying the designation fee (Rule 39(1)) and the renewal fee (Rule 51(1)) and for filing the request for examination and paying the examination fee (Rule 70(1)) may not have expired on the date the request for early processing is filed. Therefore, if any of these time limits is still running on that date (or, in the case of the renewal fee, if the due date according to Rule 51(1) is later than that date), the request for early processing will be effective without the requirement(s) concerned having been complied with (Art. 153(2), Art. 11(3) PCT).

If applicants wish not only the processing of the application before the EPO as designated/elected Office but also the examination of the application to start, they must have filed a valid request for examination (including payment of the examination fee), even if the time limit under Rule 70(1) has not yet expired at the date of effective entry into the European phase, since examination will be taken up only if a request for examination has been validly filed (see E‑IX, 2.5.2). Furthermore, if a request for examination is filed before the EPO has, where applicable, sent the supplementary European search report to the applicants, examination will start only upon receipt of an indication from them that they wish to proceed further with the application and, if required, a response to the extended European search report (see E‑IX, 2.5.3).

Rule 159(1)

For international applications filed between 1 July 2020 and 31 October 2022, correction of erroneously filed elements or parts under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT by the receiving Office is not effective in proceedings before the EPO as designated/elected Office in accordance with the EPO's declaration of incompatibility (Rule 20.8 PCT). Thus, applicants who want to make use of the abridged procedure (by requesting that the correct application documents be disregarded or by indicating that they wish to pursue the application containing the correct application documents with the date of receipt of those application documents as the filing date – see C‑III, 1.3) must inform the EPO accordingly at the time the request for early processing is validly filed or at the latest before the communication under Rules 20.8(c) PCT and Rules 82ter.1(c) PCT and Rules 82ter.1(d) PCT is issued.

The automatic debiting procedure may be used for effecting payment of the fees falling due on filing the request (see Annex A.1 and Annex A.2 to the ADA, Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2022). However, automatic debiting can only be performed if the EPO can establish whether or not a page fee needs to be included as part of the filing fee (see A‑III, 13.2). This is only possible if the EPO has access to the documents referred to in Art. 20 PCT, i.e. if:

– the international application has already been published at the time the request for early processing is received,

– the EPO is the receiving Office, or

– the EPO is acting as (S)ISA or IPEA.

If none of the above documents is available to the EPO on the day the request for early processing is filed, applicants are advised to choose another means of payment. Otherwise the fees due will be debited on the date of receipt of the documents referred to in Art. 20 PCT from the International Bureau (Rule 47.4 PCT) and the date on which the request for early processing takes effect will be postponed to that date.

If pursuant to Rule 159(1)(h) a certificate of exhibition must be filed and this requirement is not met, this will not prevent the request for early processing from being effective, but it will affect the prior art that the EPO takes into account in the European phase.

If on the date the request for early processing is filed any necessary requirement is not complied with, the request will be effective only as from the date on which all necessary requirements have been complied with.

If on the date the request for early processing is filed all necessary requirements for entry into the European phase are complied with, the request is effective and the Euro-PCT application will as from that date be processed in the same way as a Euro-PCT application which has entered the European phase by fulfilling the necessary requirements of Rule 159(1) within the 31-month time limit and without a request for early processing having been filed. On that date the international phase is thus terminated in respect of the EPO as designated/elected Office (J 18/09, Reasons 13). Moreover, since by filing an effective request for early processing the processing ban is lifted, as from that date it is no longer possible to claim the 31-month time limit under Rule 159(1). For details see the notice from the EPO dated 21 February 2013, OJ EPO 2013, 156.

Rule 20.5bis PCT

OJ EPO 2022, A32.9 Review by the EPO as a designated/elected Office and rectification of errors made by the receiving Office or the International Bureau

2.9.1 Review by the EPO under Art. 25 PCT

2.9.2 Review by the EPO under Art. 24 PCT and excuse of delays under Art. 48(2) PCT

2.9.3 Rectification of errors made by the receiving Office or the International Bureau

2.9.4 Determination of filing date in the case of erroneously filed elements or parts of the international application2.9.1 Review by the EPO under Art. 25 PCT

The EPO may decide, in accordance with Art. 25 PCT, to allow an international application deemed to be withdrawn, or not accorded a filing date, to proceed as a European application.

To obtain such a review by the EPO as designated Office, applicants must take the following steps within the two-month time limit under Rule 51.1 PCT:

– request the IB to send copies of documents in the files promptly to the EPO as designated Office,

– pay the filing fee under Rule 159(1)(c) and, where required,

– furnish a translation of the Euro-PCT application.

Applicants are recommended to undertake the remaining steps for entry into the European phase under Rule 159(1) at the same time, possibly together with a request for early processing (see E‑IX, 2.8).

The formalities officer acting on behalf of the examining division is competent to take decisions in relation to these applications (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 December 2013, OJ EPO 2014, A6), and the Receiving Section transfers copies of any documents received from the International Bureau under the circumstances of Art. 25(1)(a) PCT to the examining division. Where it is decided that the application can proceed as a European application, the search and examination is carried out as for other applications, taking into account as the date of filing of the application the date it was originally filed with the PCT receiving Office and claiming the priority date of the international application, as applicable.

Art. 25 PCT, Rules 51 and 82ter PCT Rule 159(2)2.9.2 Review by the EPO under Art. 24 PCT and excuse of delays under Art. 48(2) PCT

Pursuant to Art. 24(2) PCT, the EPO as designated/elected Office may maintain the application as a European application even if this is not required by virtue of Art. 25(2) PCT (see also OJ EPO 1984, 565, Reasons 4). The filing of a request under Art. 24(2) PCT is governed by the same requirements as a request for review under Art. 25(2) PCT (see E‑IX, 2.9.1), with the exception that the two-month time limit under Rule 51 PCT does not apply (see J 19/16, Reasons 6). Such requests may have to be combined with a request for re-establishment of rights under Art. 122 or further processing under Art. 121 (see E‑VIII, 2 and E‑VIII, 3) as the appropriate means of remedying the non-observance of a time limit under the EPC.

Art. 24(2) PCT, Art. 48(2) PCT, Rule 82bis PCT Art. 122, 1212.9.3 Rectification of errors made by the receiving Office or the International Bureau

If the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the EPO that the international filing date is incorrect owing to an error made by the receiving Office or that the priority claim has been erroneously considered not to have been made, and if the error is such that, had it been made by the EPO itself, the EPO would rectify it under the EPC, the EPO must rectify the error on the applicant's request and treat the international application as if it had been accorded the rectified international filing date or as if the priority claim had not been considered not to have been made (see also E‑IX, 2.9.1).

Rule 82ter.1(a) PCT

Further, if a receiving Office accords the international filing date on the basis of incorporation by reference of missing parts under Rule 20.5 PCT, the EPO as designated/elected Office will review of its own motion whether the requirements of Rule 82ter.1(b)(i)-(iii) PCT have been complied with. In particular, the EPO will consider whether the element or part incorporated by reference was indeed missing. For instance, where the international application contained a description and a claim or claims on the international filing date, it is not possible to replace these elements with elements from a priority application. It is also not possible to add elements from a priority application if this would result in the international application having, for instance, two (or more) descriptions or two (or more) sets of claims. As of 1 July 2020, such cases may however be handled by the receiving Office under Rule 20.5bis PCT (see E‑IX, 2.9.4 for the determination of the filing date in such a case).

Art. 11(1)(iii)(d) PCT, Art. 11(1)(iii)(e) PCT, Rule 4.18 PCT, Rule 20.5bis PCT, Rule 20.6 PCT, Rule 82ter.1(b) PCT

If the EPO does not agree with the finding of the receiving Office, it will notify the applicant that it intends to consider the (later) date on which the missing element or part was furnished as the international filing date in the European patent grant procedure, giving the applicant the opportunity to comment in accordance with Art. 113(1). In the case of missing parts, the applicant may also request that the missing part concerned be disregarded in the European patent grant procedure. In that case, the missing part will be considered not to have been furnished and the EPO will not treat the international application as if the international filing date had been corrected.

Rule 82ter.1(c) PCT, Rule 82ter.1(d) PCT2.9.4 Determination of filing date in the case of erroneously filed elements or parts of the international application

Rule 20.5bis PCT, which entered into force on 1 July 2020, allows applicants to correct an erroneously filed element (description or claims) or part of the description, claims or drawings (including all drawings) contained in an international application. Following the entry into force of new Rule 56a on 1 November 2022, the notification of incompatibility under Rule 20.8(b-bis) PCT of this provision with the EPC legal framework has been withdrawn. As a consequence, incorporation by reference by the receiving Office under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT, i.e. without changing the filing date, will be effective before the EPO as designated or elected Office for international applications filed on or after 1 November 2022.

For international applications filed between 1 July 2020 and 31 October 2022, the limitation under the procedure described in E‑IX, 2.2 and C‑III, 1.3 remains unchanged. If the receiving Office considered the correct application documents to be incorporated by reference under Rule 20.5bis(d) PCT, i.e. without changing the filing date, this incorporation will not be effective in proceedings before the EPO as designated/elected Office. For the procedure applied for establishing the filing date and the application documents forming the basis of proceedings, see C‑III, 1.3.

Rule 20.5bis PCT, Rule 20.8(b-bis) PCT2.10 Inspection of files

In its capacity as a designated Office, the EPO also allows access to its files pertaining to the international phase of applications, provided that international publication has taken place. The above applies mutatis mutandis to the communication of information from the files.

Art. 30(2) PCT Rule 94.2bis PCT

In its capacity as elected Office the EPO allows access to its files (including the entire PCT Chapter II file) relating to the international phase of applications filed on or after 1 July 1998, provided international publication has taken place and, as far as the PCT Chapter II file is concerned, the IPER has been completed.

The above applies mutatis mutandis to the communication of information from the files (see A‑XI, 2 and A‑XI, 3).

Rule 94.3 PCT3. The communication according to Rule 161

3.1 Applications for which a supplementary European search report is prepared

3.2 Applications for which no supplementary European search report is prepared

3.3 Exceptions where a reply to the Rule 161(1) invitation is not required

3.4 Rule 137(4) applies3.1 Applications for which a supplementary European search report is prepared

Where the EPO has not drawn up an international search report (as ISA) or a supplementary international search report (as the authority charged with the supplementary international search (SISA)), the application is subject to a supplementary European search under Art. 153(7) (see B‑II, 4.3.2); a supplementary European search report and search opinion are issued accordingly (see B‑XI, 1 and B-XI, 2). The first communication is then issued as in C‑III, 4.

In such cases, promptly after entry into the European phase, the applicant is invited to amend the application within a period of six months (see the notice from the EPO dated 29 June 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 406, and the notice from the EPO dated 15 October 2009, OJ EPO 2009, 533). All amendments and comments filed within this period will be taken into account in drawing up the supplementary European search report and the search opinion. The supplementary European search will be based on the last set of claims filed up to expiry of this period for which any claims fee due is paid.

The applicant may, but is not required to, reply to the WO‑ISA, IPER or SISR drawn up by an authority other than the EPO, normally in the form of amendments and/or comments filed with Form 1200 or in response to a communication under Rule 161(2). If the applicant does reply to the WO‑ISA, IPER or SISR, the supplementary search report and the search opinion will be drawn up taking this reply into account (see B‑II, 4.3 and B‑XI, 2).

For proceeding directly to supplementary European search without having to wait until the six-month time limit under Rule 161(2) expires, applicants may explicitly waive their right to a communication pursuant to Rules 161(2) and Rule 162. No communication under Rule 161(2) or Rule 162 is issued if, in addition to the waiver, the applicant has already paid any claims fees due (see the notice from the EPO dated 5 April 2011, OJ EPO 2011, 354). If not, the communication will be issued and the application will be processed only after expiry of the six-month period, even if a request under the PACE programme has been filed (see E‑VIII, 4).

When preparing the first communication in examination for such cases, the examiner may have to consider the international search report (with the corresponding International Preliminary Report on Patentability (IPRP) or the International Preliminary Examination Report (IPER)), any supplementary international search report (SISR), any supplementary European search report (with the corresponding search opinion) prepared by the EPO (see B‑II, 4.3) and any reply filed in response thereto (see C‑II, 3.1).

Rule 161(2)3.2 Applications for which no supplementary European search report is prepared

Where the EPO has drawn up an international search report (ISR) or a supplementary international search report (SISR), no supplementary European search report is prepared (see the decision of the Administrative Council of 28 October 2009, OJ EPO 2009, 594, and B‑II, 4.3.1, B‑II, 4.3.2). In these cases, a written opinion of the ISA (WO‑ISA) or a supplementary international search report (SISR) with explanations under Rule 45bis.7(e) PCT and – if the EPO was also IPEA – an international preliminary examination report (IPER) will already have been transmitted to the applicant during the international phase.

The applicant is required to respond to the WO‑ISA or SISR prepared by the EPO or, where applicable, to the IPER prepared by the EPO as IPEA. This does not apply where amendments or observations have already been filed which can be considered to be a reply (subject to certain requirements, see E‑IX, 3.3.1). The time limit for response is six months from the invitation according to Rule 161(1) and is not extendable.

The communication under Rule 161(1) is issued promptly after expiry of the time limit for entry into the European phase and is combined with the communication under Rule 162(2) inviting the applicant to pay any claims fees due (see E‑IX, 2.3.8).

Failure to respond to the WO‑ISA, SISR or IPER within this period (by filing amendments and/or comments) leads to the application being deemed to be withdrawn according to Rule 161(1) unless one of the exceptions described in E‑IX, 3.3 applies. Further processing is available for this loss of rights (see E‑VIII, 2). In all cases, the latest filed request on file after expiry of the time limit according to Rule 161(1) will then be taken into account when drafting the first communication (see E‑IX, 4.3.2) or when issuing the invitation under Rule 164(2) (see C‑III, 3.1), provided that the application is not deemed to be withdrawn.

In order to proceed with the examination of the application without having to wait until the expiry of the six-month time limit for response, applicants may explicitly waive their right to a communication pursuant to Rule 161(1) and Rule 162. Provided that, on entry into the European phase, they have also already responded, where required, to the WO‑ISA, the IPER or the SISR and paid the claims fees, no communication under Rules 161 and Rule 162 will be issued (see the notice from the EPO dated 5 April 2011, OJ EPO 2011, 354). If this is not the case, the communication will be issued and the application will be processed only after expiry of the six-month period, even in the presence of a request under the PACE programme (see E‑VIII, 4).

Where the EPO is an elected Office, the international preliminary examination report and the documents attached to it must be considered in accordance with E‑IX, 4.3.

Where a translation of the priority document is required (see A‑III, 6.8 and F‑VI, 3.4), an invitation to file it according to Rule 53(3) may be sent by the examining division only after the period according to Rule 161(1) has expired (see A‑III, 6.8.2).

Rule 161(1)3.3 Exceptions where a reply to the Rule 161(1) invitation is not required

In certain cases, even though the EPO was the ISA or the SISA, the applicant is not required to respond to the communication under Rule 161(1).

3.3.1 Earlier filed amendments or comments

3.3.2 Positive WO‑ISA, SISR or IPER

3.3.3 Rule 161 communication issued before 1 April 2010

3.3.4 Voluntary reply to Rule 161(1) communication3.3.1 Earlier filed amendments or comments

A reply to the communication under Rule 161(1) may not be necessary where amendments or observations have already been filed that can be considered to be a valid reply. This is the case in the following situations:

(i)If the applicant has filed new amendments and/or comments upon entry into the regional phase before the EPO, provided that

– the applicant has indicated on entry into the European phase that such amendments and/or comments are to form the basis for further prosecution of the application (see E‑IX, 2.1.1), and

– they constitute a valid response (see B‑XI, 8).

(ii)If the applicant filed amendments according to Art. 19 PCT and/or Art. 34 PCT in the international phase, and if the EPO prepared the WO‑ISA or SISR but no IPER (either because the applicant did not demand PCT Chapter II or because the IPEA was an office other than the EPO), then these amendments are considered to constitute a response to the WO‑ISA or SISR, provided that the applicant

– has indicated on entry into the European phase that these amendments are maintained,

– has provided a copy of the amendments under Art. 34 PCT, filed with the IPEA other than the EPO, as well as any necessary translations in the language of the proceedings.

If amendments have been filed under Art. 19 PCT or Art. 34 PCT and have been taken into consideration in the drawing up of an IPER by the EPO acting as IPEA, these are not considered to constitute a response to the IPER as required by Rule 161(1); in these cases, the applicant is required to respond to the IPER within the six-month period according to Rule 161(1).

If the requirements of Rule 137(4) were not fulfilled for amendments already filed, the required indications are to be made in reply to the Rule 161(1) communication (see E‑IX, 3.4).

In cases (i) and (ii) above, no communication under Rule 161(1) and Rule 162 is issued if applicants have explicitly waived their right to these and have already paid any claims fees due (see E‑IX, 3.2).3.3.2 Positive WO‑ISA, SISR or IPER

Where the WO‑ISA, any supplementary international search report (SISR) or, where applicable, the subsequent IPER prepared by the EPO was positive (according to the same principles explained for European search opinions in B‑XI, 3.9), the applicant is still sent a communication according to Rule 161(1), but is not required to respond to it.

No communication under Rule 161(1) and Rule 162 is issued if applicants have explicitly waived their right to these and have already paid any claims fees due (see E‑IX, 3.2).3.3.3 Rule 161 communication issued before 1 April 2010

In cases where the Rule 161 communication was already issued before 1 April 2010, there is no requirement to respond to the WO‑ISA prepared by the EPO or to the IPER prepared by the EPO as IPEA; if the applicant has not filed any amendments or comments upon entry into the regional phase before the EPO, the first communication will essentially be based on the content of said WO‑ISA or IPER prepared by the EPO.3.3.4 Voluntary reply to Rule 161(1) communication

In cases (i) and (ii) mentioned in E‑IX, 3.3.1 and the case mentioned in E‑IX, 3.3.2 where the applicants are not required to respond to the WO‑ISA, SISR or IPER prepared by the EPO (in response to the invitation under Rule 161(1)), they may still do so by filing further amendments and/or comments if they so wish. Once again it is advisable that the requirements of Rule 137(4) are fulfilled for any such amendments when they are filed, thus avoiding a further communication according to Rule 137(4).3.4 Rule 137(4) applies

In the case of Euro-PCT applications for which an international search report or supplementary European search report has been drawn up by the EPO since 1 April 2010, if amendments which are to form the basis for further examination were filed either during the Rule 161(1) time limit or earlier, the requirements of Rule 137(4) must be complied with (the amendments must be identified and the basis for them in the application as filed indicated). If the applicant has not yet complied with these requirements on expiry of the time limit according to Rule 161(1), the examining division may request him to provide this information within a period of one month, by issuing a communication according to Rule 137(4). Failure to respond to this communication in time will lead to the application being deemed to be withdrawn (see H‑III, 2.1 and H‑III, 2.1.1). The examining division may send a Rule 137(4) communication before sending a communication according to Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1), Rule 71(2) or Rule 71(3). Corresponding requirements exist for amendments made in the international phase (Rules 46.5 PCT, Rule 66.8 PCT and Rule 70.2 PCT).

Rule 137(4)4. Examination procedure

4.1 At least one communication in examination

4.2 No examination of multiple inventions in EP phase

4.3 Substantive examination of a Euro-PCT application accompanied by an IPER4.1 At least one communication in examination

If deficiencies persist in the application even after applicants have filed their response to the WO‑ISA, supplementary international search report or IPER (as required by Rule 161(1)), the examining division will in general issue at least one communication according to Art. 94(3) and Rule 71(1) and Rule 71(2) in subsequent examination proceedings and will consider the applicant's reply thereto before issuing a decision or a summons to oral proceedings. This applies regardless of whether a communication according to Rule 164(2)(a) has been issued. In exceptional cases, summons to oral proceedings may be issued as the first action in examination proceedings (see C‑III, 5).4.2 No examination of multiple inventions in EP phase

Although under PCT Chapter II, where the EPO is the IPEA, the applicant can have multiple inventions examined in one IPER if further examination fees have been paid (or if the examiner has chosen not to invite the applicant to pay further fees), in the European procedure only one invention will be examined.

In cases where protection is sought for an invention not covered by the (supplementary) international search report, by the supplementary European search report or by a search carried out under Rule 164(2) because the search fee due was not paid, the examining division must invite the applicant to limit the application to one invention covered by one of these searches. The procedure under Rule 164(2) is set out in detail in C‑III, 3.1.

Rule 164(2)

If after receipt of the (supplementary) European search report or, where applicable, after a communication under Rule 164(2)(b) the applicant files amended claims relating to an invention which differs from any of the originally claimed inventions and which does not combine with these inventions to form a single inventive concept, an objection under Rule 137(5) is raised (see also F‑V, 7 and H‑IV, 4).

Rule 137(5)4.3 Substantive examination of a Euro-PCT application accompanied by an IPER

The substantive examination is conducted in the same way as with any other European applications. Where the EPO was the International Preliminary Examining Authority, the international preliminary examination will normally have been carried out by the examiner responsible for examining the related Euro-PCT application.

The application to be examined will be accompanied by an international preliminary examination report drawn up in one of the official languages of the EPO. New documents in the original language may be attached in annex to the report (Art. 36(3)(a) PCT and Rule 70.16 PCT). The application will also be accompanied by a translation of the annexes, transmitted by the applicant, in the same language into which the international preliminary examination report was translated (Art. 36(3)(b) PCT).

Art. 14(1)

The examination must be conducted in accordance with Art. 41 PCT and Art. 42 PCT, which stipulate that:

Art. 41 PCT and Art. 42 PCT

(i)the applicant must be given the opportunity to amend the claims, the description and the drawings within a time limit prescribed pursuant to Rule 78.1(b) PCT PCT or Rule 78.2 PCT (see also Rules 159(1)(b) and Rule 161); and

(ii)the EPO cannot require that the applicant furnish copies, or information on the contents, of any papers connected with the examination relating to the same application in any other elected Office.

Rule 159(1)(b) Rule 161

4.3.1 Comparative test results

4.3.2 Basis for substantive examination

4.3.3 Consideration of the contents of the IPER4.3.1 Comparative test results

Where the EPO has established the IPER and refers therein to the submission of test reports, applicants are taken to agree to the use of these reports as the basis for proceedings before the EPO when they use the standard form for entry into the European phase before the EPO as elected Office, i.e. Form 1200. If the latter is not used or the IPER – referring to the test reports – was established by another International Preliminary Examination Authority, the applicant is invited to submit these reports for the European application.4.3.2 Basis for substantive examination

Normally, the documents which are indicated in the international preliminary examination report as forming the basis for that report will also form the basis for the substantive examination in the EPO as an elected Office in the European phase. New documents (claims, description, drawings) submitted during the international preliminary examination and replacing the earlier filed documents will be attached to the international preliminary examination report. If the documents attached to the international preliminary examination report are in a language other than the language of the proceedings of the European application in the European phase, the applicant must be requested to file the documents in the language of the proceedings within a fixed period.

The applicant may also request that the examination be based on the documents in the international application as published or on amendments made on entry into the European phase. If the declarations of the applicant are unclear in this respect, the examiner will have to clarify the situation.4.3.3 Consideration of the contents of the IPER

If the international preliminary examination report has been drawn up by the EPO, it is to be regarded as an opinion for purposes of examination, and generally the first communication will be based on the opinion expressed in the IPER and the applicant's response to it filed in accordance with Rule 161(1) (if applicable, see E‑IX, 3). Such an opinion may be departed from if new facts relevant to assessing patentability are in evidence (e.g. if further prior-art documents are to be cited or if evidence is produced of unexpected effects), where the substantive patentability requirements under the PCT and the EPC are different, where applicants provide convincing arguments, appropriate amendments or relevant counter-evidence in their response to the IPER according to Rule 161(1), or conversely where the applicant provides amendments in response to the IPER which introduce further deficiencies.

Examination reports drawn up by other International Preliminary Examining Authorities must be examined carefully. If the reasons put forward in the international preliminary examination report are sound, they must not be disregarded.

1.3 Form and content1.1 General remarks

Decisions subject to appeal are taken by the Receiving Section, the examining divisions, the opposition divisions and the Legal Division. Unless otherwise specified, the principles described in this chapter apply to all such decisions. They also apply to decisions taken by formalities officers to whom this work is entrusted (see the decisions of the President of the EPO dated 12 December 2013, OJ EPO 2014, A6, and 23 November 2015, OJ EPO 2015, A104).

According to Art. 113(1), decisions of the EPO may only be based on grounds or evidence on which the parties concerned have had an opportunity to present their comments.

This provision is intended to ensure that no party can be taken by surprise by grounds for a decision against their application on which they did not have an opportunity to present their comments.

Art. 106(1) Art. 113(1)1.2 Consideration of time limits

A decision may not be given until any time limit set has expired unless all the parties affected by the time limit expressly agree that it need no longer be observed or have submitted their final opinions before it expires. The decision to grant a patent may, however, be given once the applicant is deemed to have approved the text submitted to him under Rule 71(5) and has fulfilled all other formal requirements, even if the time limit set in the Rule 71(3) communication has not yet expired.

Moreover, as a rule, decisions will not be given until an internal EPO time limit (e.g. 20 days) following upon the official time limit (but from which the parties may derive no rights) has expired, so as to ensure that documents received at the end of the period officially allowed have actually been entered in the files when the decision is being taken and can be taken into account in the decision.

With reference to submissions and applications received after expiry of a time limit, see E‑VIII, 1.8.1.3 Form and content

Decisions are to be produced in writing. The same applies to decisions delivered at the end of oral proceedings (see E‑III, 9).

No complete rules can be laid down about the form and content of decisions, which will depend on the requirements of each particular case.

The written decision will contain:

– the names of the parties to the proceedings (applicant, proprietor, opponents) and, if applicable, their representatives;

– the order (operative part), and, if necessary;

– the facts and submissions;

– the reasoning;

– the communication of the possibility of appeal (Rule 111(2)); and

– the signature(s) and the name(s) of the employee(s) responsible.

Even in those cases in which the decision contains no communication of the means of redress, an appeal can be filed if the decision is incorrect, e.g. if the grant was not made on the basis of the documents that the applicant had approved.

If the decision is produced by the employee responsible using a computer, the EPO seal may replace the signature. If it is produced automatically by a computer the employee's name may also be dispensed with (Rule 113(2)).

Rule 113(1)

1.3.1 Order

1.3.2 Facts and submissions

1.3.3 Reasoning1.3.1 Order

The order (or "operative part") of the decision, must clearly state the request of the parties and the extent to which this request is complied with (T 756/14). It may be, for example, as follows:

"The European patent application ... is hereby refused pursuant to Art. 97(2) EPC.";

"The opposition to the European patent ... is hereby rejected."; or

"The request for re-establishment of rights is hereby rejected".1.3.2 Facts and submissions

Facts and submissions have to be given in so far as they are significant for the decision.

Under facts, a brief description of the case and a summary of the main reasons on which the decision is based and of the most important replies of the parties is given. These points, however, are to be covered in detail in the subsequent reasoning.1.3.3 Reasoning

The statement of grounds must first set out and substantiate the reasons for the decision, citing the individual EPC articles and rules involved.

For decisions taken by the examining or opposition division, see E‑X, 2.6.

The deciding instance will draft the decision based on one or more grounds forming the basis of the decision, as appropriate. It is essential that the parties have been given an opportunity to comment on all the grounds on which the decision is based.

When several grounds are used in the decision, it is imperative to link them in a logical way, in particular avoiding having a subsequent ground contradict an earlier one. Furthermore, the chain of grounds must be structured so that it starts with the main ground.

All significant arguments advanced by a party to the proceedings are carefully examined and comprehensively discussed in the decision.

In individual cases, consideration may also be given to the reasoning of those decisions which merely meet the requests of the parties. If, for example, a number of reasons are invoked for a request for re-establishment, of which only one justifies re-establishment, a reasoned decision on re-establishment may be appropriate, in order to clarify the official action.2. Decisions taken by the examining or opposition divisions

In substantive examination, applicants must have an opportunity of presenting their comments on all the grounds invoked against their application.

Before an application is refused by the examining division, the search under Art. 54(3) is completed (see also C‑IV, 7.1).

In opposition proceedings, if the patent is to be revoked, it must be ensured that the proprietor of the patent in particular is given sufficient opportunity to defend himself and, similarly, if the oppositions are to be rejected or if, despite the claims of the opponents, the patent is to be maintained in amended form, the opponents in particular must be given the same opportunity. A decision may be based on grounds indicated in a document from one of the parties, provided the document has been sent to the other parties so that they have had an opportunity to comment.

If more than two months have elapsed between despatch of the document "only for information" and the issue of the decision, this generally means that parties have had sufficient opportunity to comment and their right to be heard has therefore not been infringed (T 263/93).

If the patent is to be maintained in amended form, there must be a text of the claims and description which has been approved by the patent proprietor (D‑VI, 2), and the opponent(s) must have had an opportunity to comment on it.

2.11 Refusal to admit amendments under Rule 137(3)2.1 Right to be heard

The right to be heard is a right not just to present comments but also to have those comments duly considered. Amendments and arguments submitted by a party need to be considered, and the party must be given an opportunity to comment on the grounds and evidence brought forward by the examining division (see T 1123/04 and T 852/07). A document may not be cited for the first time in a decision (see T 635/04) unless it has been introduced during oral proceedings. The use of fresh arguments in a decision still based on grounds and evidence communicated beforehand is not precluded (see T 268/00 and T 1557/07).

If a case is remitted from the boards of appeal for further prosecution, the examining division must check whether requests from examination proceedings prior to the appeal are still outstanding and must give the party an opportunity to comment (see T 1494/05). If the facts and grounds essential to a decision have been submitted by one party and if the party whose case is to be rejected has been afforded sufficient time to comment, the principle concerning the right to be heard set out in Art. 113(1) will have been respected. If the decision in opposition proceedings is to be based on grounds which were raised in the examination proceedings but not in the notice of opposition, the observations by the parties or the communications of the opposition division, these must be introduced (i.e. raised for discussion) by the opposition division in the opposition proceedings before the decision is given so as to afford the parties an opportunity to comment. If the opposition is based on lack of inventive step, the proprietor of the patent must expect that the prior art newly designated in the opposition proceedings will be considered in conjunction with the prior art described in the introductory part of an independent claim. However, if new facts and grounds are introduced during the proceedings or if the facts and grounds on which the envisaged decision is to be based were not stated so unambiguously and clearly in the written submissions of the parties as to give a party occasion to comment, the party concerned must be given an opportunity to submit an opinion and to produce evidence before the decision is given.

A patent proprietor's right to be heard has not however been violated if, by making only minor amendments to the claims in response to a communication from the opposition division setting out the material arguments against maintaining the patent as it stands, the result is that the grounds for revoking the patent remain essentially unchanged, provided the proprietor's comments have been duly considered.

In such a case, where the obstacles to maintenance have already been put to the proprietor and continue to apply, the patent may be revoked immediately, without any need to communicate again the full arguments on which the decision would be based.2.2 Authoritative text of documents

The EPO must decide upon the European patent application or the European patent only in the text submitted to it, or agreed, by the applicant or proprietor and last used as a basis for the proceedings. Consequently, for example, an amended version proposed by the examining or opposition division (see C‑V, 1.1, D‑VI, 4.2 and D-VI, 7.2.1) may only be adopted as a basis for the decision if it has been approved by the applicant or proprietor.

In the case of one or more auxiliary requests directed to alternative texts for grant or maintenance of a patent, every such request qualifies as a text submitted or agreed by the applicant or proprietor within the meaning of Art. 113(2) (see T 234/86), and therefore must be dealt with in the order indicated or agreed to by the applicant or proprietor, up to and including the highest-ranking allowable request, if any.

When considering such requests it is essential that they are treated in the correct order. Thus, for instance, if the only allowable request is an auxiliary request, but is accompanied by a higher auxiliary request for oral proceedings (e.g. a request that oral proceedings be held if the main request cannot be granted) then a communication under Rule 71(3) could not be issued on the basis of the allowable request, but instead oral proceedings in accordance with the higher request would have to be appointed, or a further communication under Rule 71(1) issued (see E‑X, 2.9). If the order of the requests is not clear from the applicant's submissions, then it would be necessary to contact the applicant to clarify the situation before proceeding.

Art. 113(2)2.3 Requirements as to form

Decisions taken by the examining or opposition divisions have to adhere to the principles laid down in E‑X, 1. Where a decision is produced by means of a computer, the file copy contains the names and the actual signature(s) of the employee(s) responsible.

If, exceptionally, one or more division members cannot sign the decision, e.g. owing to extended illness, only a division member who was present at the oral proceedings (preferably the chair) may sign it on their behalf (see T 243/87). However, in such a situation, a brief written explanation as to why one member is signing on behalf of another must be provided (T 2348/19). A written decision signed by someone who did not take part in the oral proceedings at which the decision was pronounced is not legally valid (see T 390/86).

The presentation of the facts and the submissions, the reasoning and the communication of the means of redress are generally omitted when a decision merely meets the requests of all the parties concerned; this applies in particular to the decision to grant, which is based on the documents that the applicant has approved (Rule 71(5)). The same applies when the patent is maintained in an amended form, because this is preceded by a final interlocutory decision pursuant to Art. 106(2) concerning the documents on which the maintenance of the patent is to be based (see D‑VI, 7.2.2).

The decision must be drafted using only the language of proceedings in order to meet the requirements of Rule 111(2). Arguments of parties in another official language must be summarised in the language of proceedings. Deviation is possible in exceptional cases only, such as where necessary to address questions of fact, evidence or law, for example in relation to witness statements.

Rule 111(1)2.4 Facts and submissions

For general aspects relating to facts and submissions, see E‑X, 1.3.2. Facts and submissions which are irrelevant to the decision, e.g. requests for amendment which are not maintained, are to be omitted. It must be ensured that the facts and submissions are consistent with the contents of the minutes of oral proceedings (also see E‑III, 10.3).

The facts and submissions must clearly indicate what is the subject of the application and show on which documents the decision is based. In examination, this requirement is achieved by including a detailed reference to the application documents which are subject to the decision, including, in particular, any amendments to the claims or to the description as well as maintained auxiliary requests. In addition, the examining division may cite the text of any important claim(s) or passages of the description in the decision. In opposition, the text of the independent claim(s) and other especially important claims or passages of the description on which the decision is based must be cited verbatim in the language of the proceedings (Rule 3(2)) either by copying the text into the decision or annexing a copy of the claims. As regards the dependent claims, it may be sufficient to refer to the file content.2.5 Decision on the file as it stands

Applicants may request a decision "on the file as it stands" or "according to the state of the file", e.g. when all arguments have been sufficiently put forward in the proceedings and the applicant is interested in a speedy appealable decision. C‑V, 15 and subsections, describes the procedure to be followed in case of such a request.2.6 Reasoning of decisions

If the division is of the opinion that no patent can be granted, it will substantiate this in a decision citing the individual EPC articles and rules involved. For important general aspects relating to the reasoning of decisions, see the example below and E‑X, 1.3.3.

Example:

Often an application lacking an inventive step also lacks clarity. The decision must clearly set whether the application is refused because the subject-matter of the claims is unclear and would also lack inventive step once clarified or whether it is refused because the subject-matter of the claims lacks inventive step and would have to be clarified once the inventive step objection is overcome.

The reasoning for each of the grounds on which the decision is based must contain, in logical sequence, those arguments which justify the order. It must be complete and independently comprehensible, i.e. generally without references. If, however, a question has already been raised in detail in a particular communication contained in the file, the reasoning of the decision may be summarised accordingly and reference may be made to the relevant communication for the details.

The conclusions drawn from the facts and evidence, e.g. publications, must be made clear. In particular, there must be consistency between the reasons and the facts as set out in the decision and in the minutes (also see E‑X, 2.4). The parts of a publication which are important for the decision must be cited in such a way that those conclusions can be checked without difficulty. Therefore, reference is made to each particular passage in the publication. It is not sufficient, for example, merely to assert that the cited publications show that the subject of a claim is known or obvious, or, conversely, do not cast doubt on its patentability.

The arguments put forward by the examiner during the proceedings form the "skeleton" for the decision and already define a complete and unbroken chain of reasoning leading to refusal. The decision may be based only on reasons already communicated to the applicant (Art. 113(1)). The applicant's arguments must be dealt with either point by point at the appropriate juncture in the chain of reasoning or en bloc at the end. The latter approach is often preferable as it makes clear that the final result is based solely on reasons already communicated to the applicant in compliance with Art. 113(1). In the part refuting the applicant's arguments, the decision must make clear why none of those arguments persuaded the examining division to depart from the final result.

It is particularly important that special attention be paid to important facts and arguments which may speak against the decision made. If not, the impression might be given that such points have been overlooked. Documents which cover the same facts or arguments may be treated in summary form, in order to avoid unnecessarily long reasoning.

The need for complete and detailed reasoning is especially great when dealing with contentious points which are important for the decision; on the other hand, no unnecessary details or additional reasons need to be given which are intended to provide further proof of what has already been proven.

The decision is a standalone document and must include the statement that the application is refused. This serves to indicate that, in case of several grounds, all of them form the basis for the refusal.

The decisions will not contain any matter on which the parties have not had an opportunity to comment.

Art. 113(1) Rule 111(2)2.7 Content

The decision normally deals with all independent claims of the valid request(s) that were discussed during the proceedings. A single ground is enough to refuse an application, so it is not always necessary to deal with all the dependent claims. If however a particular dependent claim has been discussed, the decision includes the relevant arguments.

Any additional requests still outstanding must be dealt with in the refusal decision. If, for example, new oral proceedings were requested in circumstances where Art. 116(1), second sentence, applies, the decision must give the reasons for rejecting that request.

Formulations implying doubt or uncertainty, such as "seems" or "apparently", must be avoided in decisions.2.8 Analysing the parties' arguments

All significant arguments advanced by a losing party to the proceedings are carefully examined and comprehensively refuted in the decision. The decision must substantiate the division's view that none of the submitted arguments overcome the objections it has raised.

However, facts not in dispute need be mentioned only briefly. Arguments by the parties which are clearly irrelevant to the issues involved do not need to be discussed.2.9 Main and auxiliary requests

If during examination proceedings a main and auxiliary requests have been filed (see E‑X, 2.2) and none of these is allowable, the reasons for the decision to refuse the application pursuant to Art. 97(2) must not be limited to the main request, but must also comprise the reasons for the non-allowability of each auxiliary request. If one of the requests is allowable, the communication pursuant to Rule 71(3) is to be issued on the basis of the (first) allowable request and must be accompanied by a brief indication of the essential reasons why the higher-ranking requests are not allowable or not admissible (see C‑V, 1.1). If the applicant, in response to the communication pursuant to Rule 71(3), maintains higher-ranking requests which are not allowable or not admissible, a decision to refuse the application pursuant to Art. 97(2) will normally be issued (see C‑V, 4.7 and C-V, 4.6.2); the reasons must set out the grounds for the non-allowability or non-admissibility of each request which ranks higher than the allowable request. In respect of the allowable request, the decision to refuse must mention that applicants have failed to give their approval to it.

Similarly, if in opposition proceedings the proprietor has submitted in addition to the main request one or more auxiliary requests, none of which is allowable, the patent must be revoked and the decision must set out, in respect of each request submitted and maintained by the proprietor, the reasons for not allowing it. Where one of the proprietor's requests directed to the maintenance of the patent in amended form is allowable, an interlocutory decision is to be issued on the basis of the (first) allowable request; it has to set out the reasons why this request meets the requirements of the EPC and, additionally, the reasons why the higher-ranking requests do not.

In so far as a decision includes the rejection of any of the multiple requests, such decision may not be taken until the applicant or proprietor has been informed, with respect to each of these requests, of the reasons for not allowing them, so that the applicant or proprietor is not deprived of the opportunity to present comments (Art. 113(1) – right to be heard). Similarly, an opportunity to comment must be granted to the opponent(s) with respect to an auxiliary request before it is held allowable by an interlocutory decision (see D‑VI, 7.2).

Practical considerations will determine at which point in the decision the auxiliary request is dealt with.2.10 Late-filed submissions

If an examining or opposition division has exercised its discretion under Art. 114(2) or Rule 116 to refuse late-filed facts, evidence or requests, its decision must give the reasons for its refusal. A mere reference to the discretionary power given under Art. 114(2) or Rule 116 is not sufficient (see T 755/96). For details on how to exercise this discretion, see E‑VI, 2 and H‑II, 2.7.

Art. 114(2) Rule 1162.11 Refusal to admit amendments under Rule 137(3)

When, in exercising its discretion under Rule 137(3), the examining division refuses to admit amended claims, it must give reasons for so doing. For details on how to exercise this discretion, see H‑II, 2.3 and H‑II, 2.7.

If no other requests are on file, then there is no text agreed by the applicant and the application is to be refused under Art. 113(2).

Rule 137(3)3. Decisions which do not terminate proceedings – interlocutory decisions

A decision that does not terminate the proceedings as regards one of the parties is termed an interlocutory decision. An interlocutory decision can only be appealed together with the final decision unless it allows separate appeal.

The competent department will use its discretion as to the need for an interlocutory decision (see, however, D‑VI, 7.2.2 with respect to the interlocutory decision for maintenance of a patent in amended form in opposition proceedings). To avoid fragmentation of the proceedings, such decisions will be the exception rather than the rule and will be given only if the duration or cost of the proceedings as a whole is thereby reduced. The interests of the parties will also be borne in mind as appropriate.

In the normal course, an interlocutory decision will be contemplated only for the purpose of ruling that separate appeal may be made, as only in this way can a decision be obtained on a preliminary point before the final decision terminating the proceedings is reached. (The proceedings must be suspended until the decision has become final.) It is especially important to allow separate appeal where the continuation of the proceedings depends on a preliminary ruling on a fundamental point of law, e.g. where different boards of appeal have given different rulings or conflicting decisions have been given by different examining or opposition divisions and no decision on appeal has been given in the matter.

Interlocutory decisions must state the reasons on which they are taken (see E‑X, 1.3.3).

If it is decided not to allow separate appeal, the reasons for this ruling may be given in the final decision instead.

A ruling to allow a separate appeal must be part of the order of the decision (E‑X, 1.3.1) (T 756/14).

Art. 106(2)4. Binding nature of decisions on appeals

If a department has to give a decision in a case which has already been remitted by the board of appeal for further prosecution to that department, it is bound by the ratio decidendi of the board of appeal, in so far as the facts, e.g. the subject-matter of the patent and the relevant state of the art, are the same.

An opposition division is not bound by a decision of a board of appeal on appeal against a decision from an examining division (see T 167/93). The exclusive phrasing of the last sentence of Art. 111(2), only mentioning the examining division being bound by the decision on appeal against a decision of the Receiving Section, makes this clear. Opposition proceedings are entirely separate from the examination proceedings, and the opposition division is entitled to examine the facts, evidence and arguments anew, particularly since another party (the opponent) is now involved. It, however, takes due notice of the assessment of these facts, evidence and arguments as contained in the reasons of the decision of the board of appeal.

Art. 111(2)5. Information as to means of redress

Decisions of the EPO which are open to appeal must be accompanied by a written communication of the possibility of appeal. The communication must also draw the attention of the parties to the provisions laid down in Art. 106 to Art. 108 and Rules 97 and Rule 98, the text of which must be attached. The parties may not invoke the omission of the communication.

Rule 111(2)6. Notification

Decisions must be notified as a matter of course (see E‑II, 2).

Art. 1197. Expiry of the term of the European patent

According to Art. 63(1), the term of the European patent is 20 years from the date of filing of the application. Under specific circumstances the contracting states can extend that term (Art. 63(2)).

The expiry of the 20-year term does not have an effect on the pendency of the European patent application. An applicant may still have a legitimate interest in the grant of the patent in view of provisional protection provided for in Art. 67(1). This means that examination of the application must continue unless the applicant withdraws the application or allows it to lapse by not responding to a communication issued by the examining division.

Art. 63 Art. 89

An opposition or an appeal can be filed even if the European patent has been surrendered or has lapsed in all contracting states (see D‑I, 2 and E‑XII, 2 respectively). For the effect of the expiry of the 20-year term on pending opposition proceedings, see D‑VII, 5.1.

Similarly, a request for limitation or revocation can be filed after the expiry of the term of the European patent.

Rule 75 Rule 84 Rule 98Chapter XI – Impartiality of divisions the examining or opposition division

Members of the competent divisions may not take part in the decision on a case:

(i)in which they may have any personal interest (partiality for subjective reasons) or

(ii)in respect of which the party may have good reasons to suspect partiality (partiality for objective reasons).

For the objection to be admissible it must be raised immediately after the party has become aware of the reason for it. The request must also be accompanied by a reasoned statement of grounds setting out the facts and arguments in support of the objection and, where appropriate, any evidence. Unsubstantiated and merely general statements, e.g. based on the nationality of the examiner(s) concerned, are not admissible.

Any challenge to impartiality must be submitted to the competent division, which will forward it to the responsible superior of the members of the division along with the statement of the member(s) concerned on the facts and circumstances put forward by the party. The responsible superior will decide on the challenge and issue a reasoned decision in writing.

If the challenge to impartiality has been raised in written proceedings and has been considered allowable, the concerned member(s) of the division is/are replaced. If the challenge has been considered either inadmissible or not allowable, the proceedings will continue. In either case, the superior's decision will be communicated to the parties as an annex to a communication from the division or to the division's decision, and will be referred to in the facts and submissions part of division's decision.

If the challenge to impartiality is raised in oral proceedings, the proceedings are interrupted in order for the responsible superior to assess the challenge. On the same day, the oral proceedings are resumed and the parties are informed on the outcome of the assessment. If the superior considers the challenge allowable, the oral proceedings are then adjourned. Proceedings will be continued by a division in which the concerned member(s) is/are replaced. If the responsible superior holds that the challenge to impartiality is either inadmissible or not allowable, the division will inform the parties accordingly and the oral proceedings will continue. In either case, the superior's decision will be communicated to the parties, normally as an annex to the division's decision, and will be referred to in the facts and submissions part of that decision.Chapter XII – Appeals

An appeal has suspensive effect. This means that decisions may not yet become final and their effects are suspended. As the decision may not then be enforced, the following do not take place: entry in the Register of European Patents, mention in the European Patent Bulletin and, where appropriate, publication of a new specification of the European patent.

Art. 106(1)2. Appeals after surrender or lapse of the patent

An appeal may be filed against the decision of the opposition division even if the European patent has been surrendered or has lapsed for all the designated states.

Rule 983. Appeals against the apportionment of costs

The apportionment of costs of opposition proceedings cannot be the sole subject of an appeal. Parties to the proceedings who feel that they have been adversely affected by the apportionment of costs may therefore only file an appeal against the decision on costs if they also lodge an appeal against the decision on the opposition on other admissible grounds.

Rule 97(1)4. Appeals against the decision of the opposition division on the fixing of costs

In accordance with Rule 97(2), the decision of the opposition division fixing the amount of costs of opposition proceedings may be appealed if the amount is in excess of the fee for appeal.

Rule 97(2) Art. 13 RFees5. Persons entitled to appeal and to be parties to appeal proceedings

Any party to proceedings adversely affected by a decision may appeal. Any other parties to the proceedings are parties to the appeal proceedings as of right.

Art. 1076. Time limit and form of appeal

Notice of appeal must be filed with the EPO within two months of the date of notification of the decision appealed from. It must contain the name and the address of the appellant as provided in Rule 41(2)(c), an indication of the decision impugned and a request defining the subject of the appeal.

Art. 108

Rule 99(1)

The notice is not deemed to have been filed until after the fee for appeal has been paid in the amount laid down in the Rules relating to Fees under the EPC. For appeals filed on or after 1 April 2018 by natural persons and entities referred to in Rule 6(4) and (5), i.e. small and medium-sized enterprises, non-profit organisations, universities and public research organisations, a reduced fee for appeal is payable, provided that a declaration of entitlement is filed at the latest by the time of payment of the reduced fee (see the notice from the EPO dated 18 December 2017, OJ EPO 2018, A5).

Rule 6(4), Rule 6(5)

Within four months after the date of notification of the decision, a written statement setting out the grounds of appeal must be filed. In the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant must indicate the reasons for setting aside the impugned decision or the extent to which it is to be amended and the facts and evidence on which the appeal is based.

Rule 99(2)7. Interlocutory revision

7.1 General remarks

7.2 Remittal to the board of appeal

7.3 Reimbursement of appeal fees

7.4 Examples7.1 General remarks

If the department whose decision is contested considers the appeal to be admissible and well founded, it must rectify its decision. This does not apply where the appellant is opposed by another party to the proceedings.

The obligation or possibility of rectification may thus arise in connection with a decision by the Receiving Section, the Legal Division, an examining division or exceptionally an opposition division if all oppositions were withdrawn and the proprietor has filed an appeal.

Art. 109(1)

After receipt of the statement of grounds, only three months are available for rectification of the decision by the department of the first instance. That department must therefore consider the appeal with the highest priority and start the examination on admissibility immediately, and if the appeal is considered admissible in the form in which it has been filed, the competent department will start its examination on allowability immediately.

The department concerned will rectify its decision if convinced in the light of the grounds of appeal that the appeal is admissible and well founded. This could arise, for example, because:

(i)the department failed to take due account of some of the material available to it at the time the decision was made;

(ii)the department did not receive material filed at the EPO in due time before the issue of the decision, owing to an office error; or

(iii)the decision of the department concerned does not appear to be incorrect, but the applicant presents new information or evidence or files amendments to the application, which overcome the objections of the decision under appeal (see T 139/87).

For the advantages of a decision covering more than one objection, see E‑X, 2.6.

In either case, whether the appealed decision is rectified or the appeal is remitted to the board, a decision issued by the examining or opposition division may be signed only by the examiners belonging to the division at the time of signature. If an examiner is absent for a long period or has left the department, a new member must be appointed to the division.

Art. 109(2)7.2 Remittal to the board of appeal

If the appeal is not allowed within three months after receipt of the statement of grounds, it must be remitted to the competent board of appeal without delay, and without comment as to its merit. This means that the department of first instance does not address any comments of substance to the board. Internal notes made by division members about the merits of the appeal are kept in the non-public part of the dossier and are not sent to the board of appeal.

The receipt of the statement of grounds of appeal is a prerequisite for the examining division when deciding whether the appeal is well-founded. Such statements can be filed at any time within four months from the notification of the decision (Art. 108). Therefore, the examining division will wait until all the grounds are received before deciding whether to allow interlocutory revision or to remit the appeal to the board to ensure that the full content of the statement of grounds has been received.

Art. 109(2)7.3 Reimbursement of appeal fees

In the event of interlocutory revision, reimbursement of appeal fees will be ordered by the department whose decision has been impugned if such reimbursement is equitable by reason of a substantial procedural violation. This is particularly the case when essential facts or evidence were not taken into consideration in arriving at a decision, e.g. where a document filed at the EPO in good time by the party concerned is not placed in the file before a decision is reached or where the decision is based on facts or evidence on which the parties concerned had no opportunity of presenting their comments. The appeal fee is to be reimbursed, even if this was not explicitly requested by the appellant (see G 3/03).

If the decision is rectified by an interlocutory revision not because of any substantial procedural violation but e.g. because the party concerned submits amendments at the time of filing the appeal, there will be no reimbursement of appeal fees.

If the department whose decision is contested considers the requirements of Art. 109 for interlocutory revision to be fulfilled, but not the requirements of Rule 103(1)(a) for reimbursement of the appeal fee, it must rectify its decision and remit the request for reimbursement of the appeal fee to the board of appeal for a decision (see J 32/95).

The request for reimbursement of the appeal fee will be remitted to the board of appeal only if it was filed together with the appeal (see G 3/03 and T 21/02).

Rule 103(1)(a) Art. 1097.4 Examples

7.4.1 No amended claims filed with the appeal

7.4.2 Amended main/single request filed with the appeal

7.4.3 Main and auxiliary requests filed with the appeal

7.4.4 Response to communication pursuant to Rule 58 filed with the appeal7.4.1 No amended claims filed with the appeal

If the applicant has filed an appeal but no amended claims, the division checks whether the decision was correct in substance. Interlocutory revision is only allowed if the decision was not correct in substance. A refund of the appeal fee is to be ordered if a substantial procedural violation has occurred (see E‑XII, 7.3). If interlocutory revision is made and new objections arise, the division communicates these objections to the applicant as often as necessary to reach a final decision on the file; this could include holding oral proceedings (again) and/or a second refusal.

Example:

The applicant points out in the letter of appeal that the examining division has overlooked a request for oral proceedings.

The examining division looks at the file and notes that this was indeed the case: interlocutory revision must be made, even if it results in a further refusal after oral proceedings have been held. The appeal fee must be refunded.7.4.2 Amended main/single request filed with the appeal

If amendments clearly overcome the grounds for refusal, interlocutory revision is granted even if further new objections arise. This is because the applicant has the right to examination in two instances (see T 219/93).

Important criteria are (see T 47/90):

1. the text is no longer the same

2. substantial amendments have been made.

"Substantial" amendments overcome grounds for refusal vis-à-vis the documents already cited in the decision (e.g. example (d) below).

The examiner has the discretion to decide whether, in each particular case, the amendments to the claims are such that examination has to be continued on a new basis, e.g. where a completely new line of inventive-step argumentation would be necessary.

In arriving at this decision, the examiner takes into account all the grounds mentioned in the original decision, including the main or supporting arguments already raised in previous objections to patentability to which the applicant has had an opportunity to respond and to which reference is made in the grounds of refusal (e.g. objections mentioned in previous communications, during personal consultation or at oral proceedings). This is in the interest of procedural efficiency and to the benefit of the applicant (no second appeal fee necessary, see T 2445/11).

If amendments made to the independent claims clearly do not meet the requirements of Art. 123(2), interlocutory revision is not granted, but the division sends the file to the boards of appeal. If there are doubts as to whether the amendments meet the requirements of Art. 123(2) or the amendments clearly meet the requirements of Art. 123(2), the division checks whether the amended claims overcome the ground(s) for refusal as indicated above.

Examples:

(a)The applicant has included a wording that has already been suggested by the examiner, the new claims are ready for grant but the description needs to be adapted: interlocutory revision must be granted since the grounds for the refusal have been overcome.

(b)Refusal for lack of novelty only. New claims are clearly novel but not inventive. The question of inventive step had not been raised in the decision or in the previous procedure: there must be an interlocutory revision.

(c)Refusal for lack of novelty. New claim 1 filed which includes a feature from dependent claim 3. This claim had already been discussed in the decision and was considered not to be inventive: no interlocutory revision.

(d)Refusal for lack of novelty over D1. New claim 1 filed which includes a feature from the description. This feature had not been previously discussed per se; however, it is clearly disclosed in D1: no interlocutory revision since the ground for refusal – lack of novelty over D1 – has not been overcome.

(e)Refusal for lack of inventive step vis-à-vis D1 and D2. New claims filed which include a feature from the description. This feature had not been previously discussed, but is clearly disclosed in D1, and therefore there is no change in the argumentation given: no interlocutory revision since the ground for refusal – lack of inventive step vis-à-vis D1 and D2 – has not been overcome.

(f)Refusal for lack of inventive step vis-à-vis D1 and D2. New claim filed which includes five new features from the description. These features have not been previously discussed. The examiner notes that although these features are disclosed in D2, the lack-of-inventive-step argumentation would have to be revised: interlocutory revision is allowed, since (i) the applicant has made substantial amendments to overcome the objections raised in the decision and (ii) the line of argumentation has to be revised.

(g)Refusal for novelty vis-à-vis D1. New claims filed which clearly relate to unsearched subject-matter and which do not combine with the original searched claims to form a single general inventive concept: no interlocutory revision because said claims cannot be allowed in the proceedings.7.4.3 Main and auxiliary requests filed with the appeal

Interlocutory revision is never possible on the basis of an auxiliary request, even if an auxiliary request would overcome the grounds for the decision (T 919/95).

Example:

The main request is the same as the one refused (i.e. not amended). However, the auxiliary request corresponds to a suggestion made by the examining division and would thus be allowable. There can be no interlocutory revision since the applicant has the right to have the main request examined by the boards of appeal.7.4.4 Response to communication pursuant to Rule 58 filed with the appeal

If, in response to the Receiving Section's refusal of the application pursuant to Art. 90(5), the related deficiencies are fully rectified so as to overcome the grounds for refusal, interlocutory revision is granted by the Receiving Section.

Example:

On the date of filing, the drawings did not comply with the requirements set by the President under Rule 49(2). The application was subsequently refused (Art. 90(5)) since the applicant filed the same poor-quality drawings in reply to the communication under Rule 58. When filing an appeal complying with the requirements of Art. 108, the applicant also files drawings of sufficient quality, thereby correcting the deficiency on which the refusal was based. Since the underlying ground for the refusal has been overcome and the reasoning in the decision under appeal no longer applies, the Receiving Section grants interlocutory revision and does not refer the case to the boards of appeal.8. Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal

Details of the procedure before the boards of appeal, including on the acceleration of appeal proceedings, can be found in the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal (see OJ EPO 2019, A63, as amended by OJ EPO 2021, A19). The Enlarged Board of Appeal has also adopted Rules of Procedure (see OJ EPO 2015, A35).9. Remittal to the examining or opposition division after appeal

If a decision by an examining or opposition division is appealed, the board of appeal may remit the case to the division under Art. 111(1). In such cases, the exact wording of the orders must be complied with. Various situations may arise:

(a)The case is remitted for grant or maintenance in amended or limited form on the basis of a complete text which has been finally decided by the board.

(b)The case is remitted for the description to be brought into line with claims whose wording has been finally decided by the board.

(c)The case is remitted for further prosecution.

In situation (a) above, grant or maintenance is handled by the formalities officer. , and the dossier goes back to the The division merely for checking provides input by verifying the classification and title and adding any references to supplementary technical information (STIN) or newly cited documents (CDOC). The examining division also carries out a top-up search for national prior rights and provides information about whether any are found to be prima facie relevant, if this has not already been done in the proceedings. This information may assist the applicant in deciding whether to request Unitary Patent protection or choose the traditional validation route (C‑IV, 7.2).

If the applicant requests further amendments under Rule 71(6), the application will be deemed withdrawn under Rule 71(7) as the procedure under Rule 71(6) cannot be applied in view of Art. 111(2).

Where the case is remitted with the order to grant, or maintain, the patent on the basis of documents with handwritten amendments, the formalities officer on behalf of the competent division invites the applicant, or proprietor, to file a formally compliant version of the amended text under Art. 94(3) or Rule 82(2), as the case may be (see E‑III, 8.7.2 and E‑III, 8.7.3 respectively).

In situation (b) above, the board has taken a final decision on the wording of the claims which ends the matter. The division can no longer amend the claims or allow the applicant or proprietor to do so, even if new facts (e.g. new relevant citations) come to light (see T 113/92, Headnote No. 2, and T 1063/92, Headnote, second paragraph). Corrections under Rule 139, however, may still be allowable.

Applicants and proprietors should exercise all possible procedural economy when bringing the description into line with the claims' wording as decided by the board of appeal. Normally, therefore, completely retyped texts will not be accepted (see T 113/92, Headnote No. 1).

In situation (c) above, the division whose decision was appealed is bound by the board's ratio decidendi, in so far as the facts are the same (Art. 111(2)). However, new relevant documents or facts which come to light must be taken into account. In particular:

– the parties must be given the opportunity to submit further requests, and

– the division must check whether requests from examination or opposition proceedings prior to the appeal (e.g. for oral proceedings) are still outstanding – see T 892/92, Headnote.Chapter XIII – Request from a national court for a technical opinion concerning a European patent

1. General

2. Scope of the technical opinion

3. Composition and duties of the examining division

4. Language to be used

5. Procedure1. General

At the request of the competent national court trying an infringement or revocation action, the EPO is obliged, against payment of an appropriate fee, to give a technical opinion concerning the European patent which is the subject of the action. The examining divisions are responsible for the issue of such opinions.

Only requests from a national court in a contracting state will be accepted by the EPO. It is not, however, up to the EPO to check whether the requesting court is "competent" to deal with the action or not. The examining division, however, checks whether a European patent is the "subject of the action".

The examining division responsible for the technical opinion gives the parties an opportunity to submit arguments in writing if the court so permits. However, the parties have no right to be heard before the EPO. Nevertheless, where the examining division considers it necessary, it may invite the parties, via the court and provided that the court so permits, either to be heard before the examining division or to submit supplementary observations on specific points identified by the examining division. If the parties are heard, such a hearing is not considered to constitute oral proceedings within the meaning of Art. 116.

The technical opinion is not a decision of the EPO. The parties to the national proceedings therefore have no right of appeal before the EPO against an unfavourable opinion.

Art. 252. Scope of the technical opinion

The examining division is obliged to give a "technical opinion" upon request. This means that the division is bound to give an opinion only in so far as the questions put are of a technical character. However, the examining division may not be too restrictive in this regard but will attempt to assist the national court as much as is reasonably possible, while remembering that the actual decision on infringement or revocation is exclusively a matter for the national court.

Generally speaking, the examining division attempts to give a technical opinion on any question which is similar to those normally dealt with in European substantive examination work, even when the question has a legal, as well as a technical, aspect. On the other hand, the examining division will decline to make any specific statement on whether a patent is valid or on whether it is infringed. It also does not give any opinion on the extent of protection (Art. 69 and the accompanying Protocol).

A request from a national court is to be expected to be clearly and precisely formulated, so that the examining division will be in no doubt as to the questions on which the court wishes to have an opinion. Since the court is responsible for deciding the issues of law involved in the questions and since most questions include a mixture of legal and technical aspects, the court is expected where possible to separate clearly the legal aspects from the technical aspects upon which it seeks the opinion of the EPO.3. Composition and duties of the examining division

3.1 Composition

3.2 Duties3.1 Composition

The composition of the examining division to which the request is referred must be as defined in Art. 18(2). This means that the division must include three technical examiners; normally a legally qualified examiner will also be included. The main responsibility for dealing with the request up to the time of formulating the opinion is entrusted to one technical examiner, hereinafter referred to as the "primary examiner".

In order to guarantee that the opinion given is not influenced by earlier proceedings within the EPO on the application/patent in question, examiners who have taken part in such earlier proceedings as members of an examining or opposition division will be excluded from the examining division set up under Art. 25. Where this is not practicable, the national court and the parties are informed of the proposed members of the examining division under Art. 25 and of which among these members participated in European examination or opposition proceedings on the case. The court will be asked to state whether, in the circumstances, the request for a technical opinion is maintained.3.2 Duties

The primary examiner will act on behalf of the examining division and will normally be responsible for issuing communications to the court. The primary examiner also drafts the written opinion and circulates the draft to the other members of the examining division for consideration. If any changes are proposed in the draft and there are differences of view on such changes, the chair arranges a meeting to resolve the matter. The final opinion is signed by all members of the division.4. Language to be used

In principle the language to be used is the language of the proceedings of the European patent; however, if the court so requests, another official language of the EPO may be used. At least the request itself, any submissions from the parties, and any amendments to the patent must be in that language or translated into that language. The opinion is also produced in that language. However, where appropriate, the examining division will pay regard to the provisions of Art. 70(2) to Art. 70(4).

Regarding documents to be used as evidence, the provisions of Rule 3(3) apply (see A‑VII, 3).

The court or the parties are responsible for providing any translations which may be required to satisfy the above conditions.5. Procedure

It is envisaged that the procedure will normally involve the following stages.

5.1 Formalities check

5.2 Preliminary examination

5.3 Withdrawal of the request

5.4 Establishment and issue of the technical opinion

5.5 File inspection

5.6 Appearance before the national court5.1 Formalities check

The formalities officer will check whether the fee has been paid and whether there are any obvious deficiencies as to the language requirements. If there are any deficiencies in these respects, the formalities officer will write to the national court informing it that no substantive work on the opinion will begin until the deficiencies have been remedied. However, no time limit can be imposed on the court.

If the file indicates that the court permits the parties to submit written arguments to the EPO and such arguments are not already on the file, the formalities officer will write via the court to the parties giving them a time limit (say two months) for submitting such arguments.

Art. 2(1), item 20, RFees5.2 Preliminary examination

When the formal requirements have been met, and, where appropriate, the arguments of the parties are on file, the case will be referred to the directorate responsible for the technical field of the patent in order for the examining division to be established. Assuming that an examining division consisting entirely of new members can be formed or, where this is not possible, that the court maintains its request for a technical opinion (see E‑XIII, 3.1), the primary examiner will perform a preliminary examination to determine whether:

(i)the questions put by the national court are such as the examining division is competent to answer, at least in part; and

(ii)the papers filed are sufficiently complete and the necessary translations have also been filed.

If there are any deficiencies in these respects, the primary examiner will write to the national court accordingly.5.3 Withdrawal of the request

If the request for a technical opinion is withdrawn before the examining division starts any substantive work on the opinion, 75% of the fee will be refunded.

Art. 10 RFees5.4 Establishment and issue of the technical opinion

After any deficiencies as referred to in E‑XIII, 5.1 or E‑XIII, 5.2, above have been met, the examining division establishes the technical opinion as soon as possible.

The opinion is sent to the national court. Any papers received from the court which belong to the national proceedings are sent back with the opinion.5.5 File inspection

The file of a request for a technical opinion is not a file within the meaning of Art. 128 and is not available for file inspection.5.6 Appearance before the national court

If, after the opinion is issued, the national court asks the examining division to appear before it, the court is informed that the EPO is willing to send one member of the division provided that costs are paid and on the understanding that this member will be required only to answer questions on the technical opinion given and will not be required to give an opinion on additional matters unless notice in writing of these additional matters is given to the examining division at least one month before the appearance before the court.Chapter XIV – Registration of changes of name, transfers, licences and other rights

1. General

2. Responsible department

3. Transfer of the European patent application

4. Transfer of the European patent

5. Changes of name

6. Licences and other rights1. General

Pursuant to Rules 22 to Rule 24 and 85 in conjunction with Rule 143(1)(w), rights and transfer of such rights relating to an application or a European patent are registered in the European Patent Register.

Transfers and changes of name are recorded as particulars of the applicant in accordance with Rule 143(1)(f).2. Responsible department

The Legal Division of the EPO bears the sole responsibility for these registrations (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 21 November 2013, OJ EPO 2013, 600).

The Legal Division may entrust specific duties which do not require legal expertise to formalities officers (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 21 November 2013, OJ EPO 2013, 601).

Art. 203. Transfer of the European patent application

A European patent application may be transferred for one or more of the designated contracting states.

Art. 71

Art. 72 is an autonomous provision which exclusively governs the formal requirements of such transfers. The EPO registers a transfer of rights in respect of a pending European patent application (see A‑IV, 1.1.1 and J 10/93) in the European Patent Register on request, upon fulfilment of the prerequisites of Rule 22. The request is not deemed to have been filed until an administrative fee has been paid. The amount of the fee is determined by the latest schedule of fees and expenses of the EPO (see epo.org).

Where the request relates to multiple applications, a separate fee has to be paid for each application.

With effect from the entry into force of amended Rule 22(1) on 1 April 2024, the conditions under which payment of an administrative fee is due is laid down by the President of the EPO.

Rule 22 furthermore requires the production of documents providing evidence of such a transfer. Any kind of written evidence suitable for proving the transfer is admissible. This includes formal documentary proof such as the instrument of transfer itself (the original or a copy thereof) or other official documents or extracts thereof, provided that they immediately verify the transfer (J 12/00). Art. 72 requires that, for an assignment, the signatures of the parties appear on the documents submitted as evidence of the transfer. Assignment documents filed electronically (see A‑II, 1.1.1 A‑II, 1.2.2) may, instead of handwritten signatures, bear qualified electronic signatures (see notice from the EPO dated 22 October 2021; OJ EPO 2021, A86).

With effect from the entry into force of amended Rule 22(1) on 1 April 2024, electronic signatures as determined by the President of the EPO are accepted on assignment documents.

Where a document is signed on behalf of a legal person, only such persons as are entitled to sign by law, by the legal person's articles of association or equivalent or by a special mandate may do so. National law applies in that respect. In all cases, an indication of the signatory's entitlement to sign, e.g. his/her position within the legal entity where the entitlement to sign results directly from such a position, is to be given. The contracting parties have to ensure that the signatories are duly authorised in accordance with the national law applicable to sign such a document. The EPO, however, reserves the right to request documentary proof of the signatory's authority to sign if the circumstances of a particular case necessitate this. In such cases, if the evidence presented is found to be unsatisfactory, the EPO informs the party requesting the transfer accordingly and invites them to remedy the stated deficiency within a given time limit. Where the entitlement results from a special authorisation, this authorisation (a copy thereof, which need not be certified) has to be submitted in every case. The EPO will in particular examine whether the signatory is empowered to enter into a legally binding contract on behalf of the legal entity.

As a general rule, the authorisation to represent a party in proceedings before the EPO within the meaning of Rule 152, be it an individual or a general authorisation, is not as such considered to empower the representative to enter into such a contract.

If the evidence presented is found to be unsatisfactory, the EPO informs the party requesting the transfer accordingly, and invites it to remedy the stated deficiencies within a given time limit.

If the request complies with the requirements of Rule 22(1), the transfer is registered with the date on which the request, the required evidence or the fee has been received by the EPO, whichever is the latest. In case of a minor deficiency, i.e. if all requirements were present but not fulfilled completely (e.g. the request was signed but the name and/or position of the person signing were missing), once rectified the effective date is the date of receipt of the original request for registration.

Art. 72 Rule 22(1) and Rule 22(2)

On the above date, the transfer becomes effective vis-à-vis the EPO, i.e. from that date the newly registered applicant is entitled to exercise the right to the European patent application in proceedings before the EPO (Art. 60(3)). If the transfer was for certain designated states only, Art. 118 applies.

Rule 22(3)

Once a transfer has been duly entered in the European Patent Register, the registration cannot be undone, even if it appears that one or more requirements were actually not fulfilled for reasons not apparent at the time when the transfer was registered by the EPO, e.g. where doubts arise later as to the entitlement of the person signing on behalf of one of the parties to enter such a transfer agreement (see decisions J 16/14 to J 22/14). The original status quo is no longer restored until the valid legal situation has been established. In the meantime, proceedings may have to be stayed under Rule 14 or 78 until it is clear who the legitimate applicant/proprietor is.

Art. 204. Transfer of the European patent

Rule 22 applies mutatis mutandis to the registration of a transfer of the European patent during the opposition period or during opposition proceedings.

Rule 855. Changes of name

Mere changes of name, i.e. changes that do not involve a modification of the legal identity of the applicant, can be entered in the European Patent Register upon request and production of relevant documentary evidence as long as the application (cf. A‑IV, 1.1.1) or the proceedings before the EPO are pending. Such registration is free of charge.6. Licences and other rights

6.1 Registration

6.2 Cancellation of the registration6.1 Registration

A European patent application may give rise to rights in rem, may be licensed and may be the subject of legal means of execution. This includes contractual licences only (Art. 73). Licences and other rights may be geographically limited to parts of the territories of the designated contracting states only.

In the case of co-applicants, the registration of licences requires the consent of each of the co-applicants.

Rule 22(1) and Rule 22(2) apply mutatis mutandis to the registration of the grant, establishment or transfer of such rights (see E‑XIV, 3).

A licence will be recorded in the European Patent Register as an exclusive licence if the applicant and the licensee so require. A licence will be recorded as a sub-licence where it is granted by a licensee whose licence is recorded in the European Patent Register.

Art. 71 Art. 73 Rule 23(1) Rule 24(a) and Rule 24(b)6.2 Cancellation of the registration

A registration of licences or other rights is cancelled upon request, supported by documents providing evidence that the right has lapsed or by the written consent of the proprietor of the right to the cancellation of that right. Rule 22(2) applies mutatis mutandis, i.e. the cancellation is subject to the payment of an administrative fee. Cancellation is only possible until publication of the mention of the grant.

Rule 22(2) Rule 23(2)Part F The European Patent Application

ContentsChapter I – Introduction

Apart from the requirements of patentability (novelty, inventive step, industrial application and exclusions from patentability), a European patent application must also satisfy a number of other requirements. These include substantive requirements such as sufficiency of disclosure (Art. 83), clarity of the claims (Art. 84) and unity of invention (Art. 82) as well as requirements of a more formal nature such as the numbering of the claims (Rule 43(5)) and the form of the drawings (as determined by the President under Rule 49(2)). These requirements are dealt with in the present Part F.

Part F also deals with the requirements relating to the right to priority. This is because, despite the fact that this issue is usually assessed only when it has a potential bearing on a question of patentability (see G‑IV, 3), it is nonetheless assessed independently of any issues of patentability.Chapter II – Content of a European patent application (other than claims)

Annex 2 – Units recognised in international practice as determined by the President under Rule 49(2) (see F‑II, 4.13)1. General

The requirements for a European patent application are set out in Art. 78. The application must contain:

Art. 78

(i)a request for the grant of a European patent;

Art. 78(1)(a)

(ii)a description of the invention;

Art. 78(1)(b)

(iii)one or more claims;

Art. 78(1)(c)

(iv)any drawings referred to in the description or the claims; and

Art. 78(1)(d)

(v)an abstract.

This Chapter deals with all these requirements, in so far as they are the concern of the search or examining division, with the exception of item (iii) which is the subject of Chapter F‑IV. Item (v) is dealt with first.

Art. 78(1)(e)2. Abstract

2.1 Purpose of the abstract

2.2 Definitive content

2.3 Content of the abstract

2.4 Figure accompanying the abstract

2.5 Checklist

2.6 Transmittal of the abstract to the applicant

2.7 Abstract in examination2.1 Purpose of the abstract

The application must contain an abstract. The purpose of the abstract is to give brief technical information about the disclosure as contained in the description, claims and any drawings. The abstract is merely for use as technical information and in particular cannot be used for the purpose of interpreting the scope of the protection sought. The abstract needs to be drafted so that it constitutes an efficient instrument for searching in the particular technical field and for evaluating if it is worth considering the whole content of the application.

Rule 57(d) Rule 47(5)2.2 Definitive content

The abstract is initially supplied by the applicant. The search division has the task of determining its definitive content, which will normally be published with the application. In doing this, it considers the abstract in relation to the application as filed (see B‑X, 7(i)). If the search report is published later than the application, the abstract, published with the application will be the one resulting from the examination referred to in B‑X, 7(i), third sentence.

Rule 66 Rule 68

In determining the definitive content, the search division takes into consideration the purpose of the abstract (see F‑II, 2.1).

Art. 85 Rule 47(5)2.3 Content of the abstract

The abstract must:

(i)indicate the title of the invention

Rule 47(1)

(ii)indicate the technical field to which the invention pertains;

Rule 47(2)

(iii)contain a concise summary of the disclosure as contained in the description, the claims and any drawings, which must be so drafted as to allow a clear understanding of the technical problem, the gist of the solution of that problem through the invention and the principal use or uses of the invention and, where applicable, it should contain the chemical formula which, among those contained in the application, best characterises the invention;

Rule 47(2)

(iv)not contain statements on the alleged merits or value of the invention or its speculative application;

Rule 47(2)

(v)preferably not contain more than one hundred and fifty words; and

Rule 47(3)

(vi)if the application contains drawings, be accompanied by an indication of the figure or exceptionally more than one figure of the drawings which should accompany the abstract. Each main feature mentioned in the abstract and illustrated by a drawing needs to be followed by a reference sign in parenthesis.

4.14 Registered trade marks4.1 General remarks

The application must disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art.

The "person skilled in the art" for this purpose is considered to be the skilled practitioner in the relevant field aware not only of the teaching of the application itself and the references therein, but also of what was common general knowledge in the art at the date of filing (date of priority) of the application. They are assumed to have at their disposal the means and the capacity for routine work and experimentation, which are normal for the technical field in question. As "common general knowledge" can generally be considered the information contained in basic handbooks, monographs and textbooks on the subject in question (see T 171/84). As an exception, it can also be the information contained in patent specifications or scientific publications, if the invention lies in a field of research which is so new that the relevant technical knowledge is not yet available from textbooks (see T 51/87). Sufficiency of disclosure must be assessed on the basis of the application as a whole, including the description, claims and drawings, if any. The provisions relating to the content of the description are set out in Rule 42. The purpose of the provisions of Art. 83 and Rule 42 is:

(i)to ensure that the application contains sufficient technical information to enable a skilled person to put the invention as claimed into practice; and

(ii)to enable the skilled person to understand the contribution to the art which the invention as claimed has made.

Art. 83 Rule 424.2 Technical field

The invention should be placed in its setting by specifying the technical field to which it relates, for example by reproducing the first ("prior art") portion of the independent claims in full or in substance or by simply referring to it.

If claims are amended, the "field of the invention" and "summary of the invention" may also need to be amended to correspond to the claims. If appropriate, it is possible to use statements like "the invention is set out in the appended set of claims" instead of repeating the claims verbatim.

Rule 42(1)(a)4.3 Background art

The description should also mention any background art of which the applicant is aware, and which can be regarded as useful for understanding the invention and its relationship to the prior art; identification of documents reflecting such art, especially patent specifications, should preferably be included. This applies in particular to the background art corresponding to the first ("prior art") portion of the independent claim or claims (see F‑IV, 2.2).

In principle, when filing an application the applicant should cite in the description the closest prior art known to them. It may happen that the prior art cited by the applicant is not the closest existing for the claimed invention. Therefore, the documents cited in the application as filed do not necessarily describe the known innovations closest to the claimed invention, but may in fact constitute more distantly related prior art.

The insertion into the statement of prior art of references to documents identified during examination may be necessary to put the invention into proper perspective (see T 11/82). For instance, while the originally filed description of prior art may give the impression that the inventor has developed the invention from a certain point, the cited documents may show that certain stages in, or aspects of, this alleged development were already known. In such a case the examining division requires a reference to these documents and a brief summary of the relevant contents. The subsequent inclusion of such a summary in the description does not contravene Art. 123(2). The latter merely lays down that, if the application is amended, for example by limiting it in the light of additional information on the background art, its subject-matter must not extend beyond the content of the application as filed. But the subject-matter of the European patent application within the meaning of Art. 123(2) is to be understood – starting off from the prior art – as comprising those features which, in the framework of the disclosure required by Art. 83, relate to the invention (see also H‑IV, 2.1). In addition, relevant prior-art documents not cited in the original application may be subsequently acknowledged in the description even if these were known to the applicant at the time of filing (T 2321/08 and H‑IV, 2.2.7).

References to the prior art introduced after filing must be purely factual. Any alleged advantages of the invention must be adjusted if necessary, in the light of the prior art.

New statements of advantage are permissible provided that they do not introduce into the description matter which extends beyond the content of the application as filed (see H‑V, 2.2).

The applicant may cite documents in the application which relate to standard technical knowledge (background art neither addressing the same technical problem nor necessary to complete the disclosure of the claimed invention). Such citations typically relate to well-known tests for measuring certain parameters mentioned in the description or to the definitions of terms of established meaning that are used in the application. Usually they are not relevant for assessing the patentability of the claimed invention, unless for example they contain relevant information which the applicant does not mention in the description.

Acknowledgment of prior art relevant to the dependent claims only is generally not required. If the applicant indicates that subject-matter initially cited as prior art is only "in-house state of the art", such prior art may not be used in the assessment of novelty and inventive step (see T 654/92, Reasons 4, and T 1001/98, Reasons 3). However, it may be allowed to remain in the description, provided the fact that it is only "in-house state of the art" is made clear.

Rule 42(1)(b) Art. 123(2)

If the relevant prior art consists of another European patent application falling within the terms of Art. 54(3), this relevant prior document belongs to the state of the art for all contracting states. This is the case even if the two applications do not share any commonly designated state, or the designation of commonly designated states has been dropped (see G‑IV, 6). The fact that this document falls under Art. 54(3) must be explicitly acknowledged. Thus the public is informed that the document is not relevant to the question of inventive step (see G‑VII, 2). According to Rule 165, the above also applies to international applications designating EP, for which the filing fee pursuant to Rule 159(1)(c) has been validly paid and, where applicable, the translation into one of the official languages has been filed (Art. 153(3) and Art. 153(4)) (see G‑IV, 5.2).

Art. 54(4) EPC 1973

4.3.1 Format of background art citations4.4 Irrelevant matter

Since the skilled person is presumed to have the general technical background knowledge appropriate to the art, the examining division does not require the applicant to insert anything in the nature of a treatise or research report or explanatory matter which is obtainable from textbooks or is otherwise well-known. Likewise the examining division does not require a detailed description of the content of cited prior documents. It is sufficient that the reason for the inclusion of the reference is indicated, unless in a particular case a more detailed description is necessary for a full understanding of the invention of the application (see also F‑III, 8 and F‑IV, 2.3.1).

A list of several reference documents relating to the same feature or aspect of the prior art is not required; only the most appropriate need be referred to. On the other hand, the examining division does not insist upon the excision of any such unnecessary matter, except when it is very extensive (see F‑II, 7.4).

Rule 48(1)(c)4.8 Reference signs

The description and drawings need to be consistent with one another, especially in the matter of reference numbers and other signs, and each number or sign must be explained. However, where as a result of amendments to the description whole passages are deleted, it may be tedious to delete all superfluous references from the drawings and in such a case the examining division does not pursue an objection under Art. 1(2)(i) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 (OJ EPO 2022, A113) as to consistency too rigorously. The reverse situation should never occur, i.e. all reference numbers or signs used in the description or claims must also appear on the drawings.

OJ EPO 2022, A1134.9 Industrial application

The description should indicate explicitly the way in which the invention is capable of exploitation in industry, if this is not obvious from the description or from the nature of the invention. The expression "capable of exploitation in industry" means the same as "susceptible of industrial application", and indeed identical expressions are used in the French and German texts of the EPC. In view of the broad meaning given to the latter expression by Art. 57 (see G‑III, 1), it is to be expected that, in most cases, the way in which the invention can be exploited in industry will be self-evident, so that no more explicit description on this point will be required; but there may be a few instances, e.g. in relation to methods of testing, where the manner of industrial exploitation is not apparent and must therefore be explicitly indicated.

Rule 42(1)(f) Art. 52(1) Art. 57

Also, in relation to certain biotechnological inventions, i.e. sequences and partial sequences of genes, the industrial application is not self-evident. The industrial application of such sequences must be disclosed in the patent application (see G‑III, 4).

Rule 29(3)4.10 Manner and order of presentation

The manner and order of presentation of the description should be that specified in Rule 42(1), i.e. as set out above, unless, because of the nature of the invention, a different manner or a different order would afford a better understanding. Since the responsibility for clearly and completely describing the invention lies with the applicant, the examining division does not object to the presentation unless satisfied that such an objection would be a proper exercise of its discretion.

Some departure from the requirements of Rule 42(1) is acceptable, provided the description is clear and orderly and all the requisite information is present. For example, the requirements of Rule 42(1)(c) may be waived where the invention is based on a fortuitous discovery, the practical application of which is recognised as being useful, or where the invention breaks entirely new ground. Also, certain technically simple inventions may be fully comprehensible with the minimum of description and only slight reference to prior art.

Rule 42(2)4.14 Registered trade marks

It is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that registered trade marks are acknowledged as such in the description. For the assessment of the clarity of claims referring to a trade mark (Art. 84), see F‑IV, 4.8. With regard to the effect of references to trade marks on sufficiency of disclosure (Art. 83), see F‑III, 7.6. Sequence listings

For the presentation of sequence listings in general, see A‑IV, 5.

6.1 Reference to sequences disclosed in a database

6.2 Sequences that need to be itemised in the sequence listing6.1 Reference to sequences disclosed in a database

The application may refer to a biological sequence belonging to the state of the art by merely providing the sequence's accession number and its version or release number in a publicly available database, without presenting the sequence itself either in a sequence listing complying with the applicable WIPO standard or in any other format.

Since in this case the sequence is already publicly available, the applicant does not need to supply a sequence listing. This applies even if reference is made to these sequences in one or more claims or if the sequences are essential features of the invention or necessary for the prior-art search (see J 8/11). If the European patent application discloses nucleotide or amino acid sequences that are fragments or variants of a prior-art sequence, a sequence listing complying with the applicable WIPO standard has to be filed for these sequence fragments or variants (see the notice from the EPO dated 9 December 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A97, p. 7). If the database and/or the sequences in question is/are not completely and unambiguously identified, the sequences are not sufficiently disclosed according to Art. 83 and cannot be added to the application to complete the disclosure without contravening Art. 123(2) (see F‑III, 2).

If such insufficiently disclosed sequences are not essential features of the claimed invention, normally no objection is raised. On the other hand, where these sequences are essential features of at least a part of the claimed subject-matter, this results in problems relating to the sufficiency of the original disclosure according to Art. 83, because the nature of the sequences cannot be unambiguously derived from the incomplete or ambiguous reference to the database.

Examples where a biological sequence is considered an essential feature of the invention would be a diagnostic method using a particular nucleic acid sequence or a product made by a biochemical process using an enzyme with a particular amino acid sequence. An example of ambiguous identification would be the citation of an accession number of a certain protein in the database of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory EMBL with no indication of which version number or database release number is meant when there are several such numbers referring to different sequences of the protein.6.2 Sequences that need to be itemised in the sequence listing

6.2.1 Requirements relating to sequence length and enumeration of residues

6.2.2 Sequences comprising residues that are not specifically defined (n or X)

6.2.3 Variants

6.2.4 The qualifier "mol_type"6.2.1 Requirements relating to sequence length and enumeration of residues

As defined in paragraph 7 of the WIPO Standard ST.26, a sequence must be included in the sequence listing if:

1. it is disclosed anywhere in the application by enumeration of its residues, i.e. by listing, in order, each residue of the sequence as defined in paragraph 3(c) of WIPO Standard ST.26 (e.g. aagtgttcctagtg), and

2. it contains 10 or more specifically defined nucleotides or four or more specifically defined amino acids.

According to ST.26, "specifically defined" residues are any nucleotide other than those represented by the symbol "n" and any amino acid other than those represented by the symbol "X", listed in Annex I (see paragraph 3(k) of WIPO Standard ST.26).

Degenerate symbols representing a subgroup of residues are considered as specifically defined. For example, the degenerate nucleotide symbol "s" (used to represent "c" or "g" as defined in Annex I, Table 1 of ST.26) is specifically defined.

Sequences containing fewer than ten specifically defined nucleotides, or fewer than four specifically defined amino acids must not be included in the sequence listing (WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 8).

If a sequence is only disclosed in prose, i.e. a text describing the sequence, but the sequence is not enumerated, then the sequence does not have to be included, but may be included if the applicant wishes so.

For instance, if the application refers to a partial sequence as follows: "nucleotides 90-179 of SEQ ID NO. 1", the partial sequence is described in prose only and, therefore, does not have to be entered as a separate SEQ ID in the sequence listing.

However, if the partial sequence was described by enumerating only the residues between positions 90 and 179, then paragraph 7 of WIPO Standard ST.26 would apply and the partial sequence would have to be included in the sequence listing.6.2.2 Sequences comprising residues that are not specifically defined (n or X)

If an enumerated sequence comprises regions of specifically defined residues separated by one or more gaps of n or X, i.e. residues that are not specifically defined, the representation of this sequence in the sequence listing depends on whether the exact number of n or X residues is known (see WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 36) or unknown (see WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 37).

For example, considering that the following sequence is enumerated in the application:

a10nxt12

if the number of "n" residues is known, e.g. x=2, the sequence should be represented as a single SEQ ID (if it also meets the minimal length requirement as defined in paragraph 7 or ST.26 and in F‑II, 6.2.1) as follows:

aaaaaaaaaanntttttttttttt

If the number of "n" residues is unknown, each region of specifically defined residues that meets the minimal length requirement in paragraph 7 of WIPO Standard ST.26 must be included in the sequence listing as a separate SEQ ID.

For example, for the sequence: a10nxt12

the sequence listing must have two entries

SEQ ID No. 1: aaaaaaaaaa

SEQ ID No. 2: tttttttttttt

The sequences should be annotated to indicate that they are part of the same molecule and separated by an undefined number of "n" residues (see example 37-2 of Annex VI of WIPO Standard ST.26).

If a range is disclosed, e.g. x= 5-10 nucleotides, the sequence should be represented as a single SEQ ID comprising 5 n or 10 n (see example 36-3 of Annex VI of WIPO Standard ST.26).

In the above example, the sequence must either comprise 5 n or 10 n. In both cases, the SEQ ID must be annotated with a "note" qualifier. In cases where the sequence comprises 5 n, the note should indicate that up to 5 n can be added. In cases where the sequence comprises 10 n, the note should indicate that up to 5 n can be deleted. The appropriate feature key must be associated with the "note" qualifier describing the variant. See paragraph 96 of WIPO Standard ST.26 and F‑II, 6.2.3 for information on selecting the correct feature key.

Alternatively, if a range is disclosed, e.g. x= 5-10 nucleotides, all possible variants may be represented independently, i.e. as separate SEQ IDs.6.2.3 Variants

If the application describes variants of a sequence, e.g. "nucleotides 90-179 of SEQ ID No. 1 are deleted or substituted by another sequence", then paragraph 95 of WIPO Standard ST.26 applies. This paragraph defines that these variants should be described by annotation of the primary sequence. It is a recommendation but it is not compulsory as long as the specific variant sequence is not enumerated as such in the application.

If the applicant chooses to enter this information in the sequence listing, the following rules as defined in paragraph 95 of ST.26 should be followed:

(a)the variant may be represented by annotation of the primary sequence, where it contains variation(s) at a single location or multiple distinct locations and the occurrences of those variations are independent,

(b)the variant should be represented as a separate sequence and assigned its own sequence identification number, where it contains variations at multiple distinct locations and the occurrences of those variations are interdependent, and

(c)must be represented as a separate sequence and assigned its own sequence identification number, where it contains an inserted or substituted sequence that contains in excess of 1 000 residues.

The following table indicates which feature key and qualifier should be used to annotate the variants according to the type of sequence and the type of variation (see paragraph 96 of WIPO Standard ST.26).

Type of sequence Feature key Qualifier Use Nucleic acid Variation replace or note Naturally occurring mutations and polymorphisms, e.g. alleles, RFLPs. Nucleic acid misc_difference replace or note Variability introduced artificially, e.g. by genetic manipulation or by chemical synthesis. Amino acid VAR_SEQ note Variant produced by alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, alternative initiation and ribosomal frameshifting. Amino acid VARIANT note Any type of variant for which VAR_SEQ is not applicable.6.2.4 The qualifier "mol_type"

The feature key "source" is mandatory for every sequence, in addition to the qualifiers "organism" and "mol_type" (paragraph 75 of WIPO Standard ST.26).

The value of the "mol_type" qualifier has to be selected from a list of predetermined terms as defined in Annex I of WIPO Standard ST.26 (section 6, qualifier mol_type 6.39; section 8, qualifier mol_type 8.1) and shown in the following table:

DNA RNA AA genomic DNA other DNA unassigned DNA genomic RNA mRNA tRNA rRNA transcribed RNA viral cRNA other RNA unassigned RNA protein

The value "genomic DNA" does not imply that the molecule is nuclear (e.g. organelle and plasmid DNA must be described using "genomic DNA").

Ribosomal RNA genes must be described using "genomic DNA".

The value "rRNA" must only be used if the ribosomal RNA molecule itself has been sequenced.

The values "other RNA" and "other DNA" must be applied to synthetic molecules, i.e. molecules that have been artificially created.

The values "unassigned DNA" and "unassigned RNA", on the other hand, must be used for molecules that have been isolated from an organism but their nature is not known or not disclosed and they cannot be assigned to any more precise qualifier value (e.g. it is not known whether the sequence is a tRNA or an mRNA or another type of natural RNA).7. Prohibited matter

7.1 Categories

7.2 Matter contrary to "ordre public" or morality

7.3 Disparaging statements

7.4 Irrelevant or unnecessary matter

7.5 Omission of matter from publication7.1 Categories

There are three categories of specifically prohibited matter, these being defined in sub-paragraphs Rule 48(1)(a) to Rule 48(1)(c) of Rule 48(1) (see also G‑II, 4).

Rule 487.2 Matter contrary to "ordre public" or morality

The omission, from the publication of the application, is mandatory for the first category (Rule 48(1)(a)). Examples of the kind of matter coming within this category are: incitement to riot or to acts of disorder; incitement to criminal acts; racial, religious or similar discriminatory propaganda; and grossly obscene matter.

With regard to patentability issues with such matter, see G‑II, 4.1 and subsections.

Rule 48(1)(a)7.3 Disparaging statements

It is necessary to discriminate in the second category between libellous or similarly disparaging statements, which are not allowed, and fair comment, e.g. in relation to obvious or generally recognised disadvantages, or disadvantages stated to have been found and substantiated by the applicant, which, if relevant, is permitted.

Rule 48(1)(b)7.4 Irrelevant or unnecessary matter

The third category is irrelevant or unnecessary matter: such matter is specifically prohibited under Rule 48(1)(c) only if it is "obviously irrelevant or unnecessary", for instance, if it has no bearing on the subject-matter of the invention or its background of relevant prior art (see also F‑II, 4.4). The matter to be removed may already be obviously irrelevant or unnecessary in the original description. It may, however, be matter which has become obviously irrelevant or unnecessary only in the course of the examination proceedings, e.g. owing to a limitation of the claims of the patent to one of originally several alternatives. When matter is removed from the description, it must not be incorporated into the patent specification by reference to the corresponding matter in the published application or in any other document (see also F‑III, 8).

Rule 48(1)(c)7.5 Omission of matter from publication

Generally, the Receiving Section will deal with matter falling under category 1(a) and may have dealt with matter obviously falling within category 1(b), but if any such matter has not been so recognised and has therefore not been omitted from the publication of the application, it is required to be removed during examination of the application together with any other prohibited matter. The applicant is informed of the category under which matter is required to be removed.

Definitions of SI base units:

– Unit of time

The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency ΔνCs, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s–1.

– Unit of length

The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299 792 458 when expressed in the unit m/s, where the second is defined in terms of ΔνCs.

– Unit of mass

The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.626 070 15 × 10–34 when expressed in the unit J s, which is equal to kg m2 s–1, where the metre and the second are defined in terms of c and ΔνCs.

– Unit of electric current

The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be 1.602 176 634 × 10–19 when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s, where the second is defined in terms of ΔνCs.

– Unit of thermodynamic temperature

The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant k to be 1.380 649 × 10–23 when expressed in the unit J K–1, which is equal to kg m2 s–2 K–1, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and ΔνCs.

– Unit of amount of substance

The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole contains exactly 6.022 140 76 × 1023 elementary entities. This number is the fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, NA, when expressed in the unit mol–1 and is called the Avogadro number.

The amount of substance, symbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron, any other particle or specified group of particles.

– Unit of luminous intensity

The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of luminous intensity in a given direction. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 × 1012 Hz, Kcd, to be 683 when expressed in the unit lm W–1, which is equal to cd sr W–1, or cd sr kg–1 m–2 s3, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and ΔνCs.

11. Sufficiency of disclosure and clarity

12. Sufficiency of disclosure and inventive step1. Sufficiency of disclosure

A detailed description of at least one way of carrying out the invention must be given. Since the application is addressed to the person skilled in the art, it is neither necessary nor desirable that details of well-known ancillary features are given, but the description must disclose any feature essential for carrying out the invention in sufficient detail to render it apparent to the skilled person how to put the invention into practice. A single example may suffice, but where the claims cover a broad field, the application is not usually regarded as satisfying the requirements of Art. 83 unless the description gives a number of examples or describes alternative embodiments or variations extending over the area protected by the claims. However, regard must be had to the facts and evidence of the particular case. There are some instances where even a very broad field is sufficiently exemplified by a limited number of examples or even one example (see also F‑IV, 6.3). In these latter cases the application must contain, in addition to the examples, sufficient information to allow the person skilled in the art, using common general knowledge, to perform the invention over the whole area claimed without undue burden and without needing inventive skill (see T 727/95). In this context, the "whole area claimed" is to be understood as substantially any embodiment falling within the ambit of a claim, even though a limited amount of trial and error may be permissible, e.g. in an unexplored field or when there are many technical difficulties (see T 226/85 and T 409/91).

However when assessing sufficiency of disclosure, the intrinsic limitations that a sensible reading imposes on the subject-matter of the independent claims must be taken into consideration; in other words the person skilled in the art wishing to implement the claimed invention will exclude any embodiment that is meaningless and not consistent with the teaching of the application (see T 521/12).

With regard to Art. 83, an objection of lack of sufficient disclosure presupposes that there are serious doubts, substantiated by verifiable facts (see T 409/91 and T 694/92). If the examining division is able, under the particular circumstances, to make out a reasoned case that the application lacks sufficient disclosure, the onus of establishing that the invention may be performed and repeated over substantially the whole of the claimed range lies with the applicant (see F‑III, 4).

Rule 42(1)(e) Art. 83

For the requirements of Art. 83 and of Rule 42(1)(c) and Rule 42(1)(e) to be fully satisfied, it is necessary that the invention is described not only in terms of its structure but also in terms of its function, unless the functions of the various parts are immediately apparent. Indeed, in some technical fields (e.g. computers), a clear description of function may be much more appropriate than an over-detailed description of structure.

Art. 83 Rule 42(1)(c) and Rule 42(1)(e)

In cases where it is found that an application is sufficiently disclosed according to Art. 83 only in respect of a part of the claimed subject-matter, this may have led to the issuing of a partial European or supplementary European search report according to Rule 63 (see B‑VIII, 3.1 and B‑VIII, 3.2). In such cases, in the absence of appropriate amendment, an objection under Rule 63(3) will also arise (see H‑II, 5 and H‑IV, 4.1.1).

Rule 632. Art. 83 vs. Art. 123(2)

It is the responsibility of the applicants to ensure that they supply on filing their application, a sufficient disclosure, i.e. one that meets the requirements of Art. 83 in respect of the invention as claimed in all of the claims. If the claims define the invention, or a feature thereof, in terms of parameters, the application as filed must include a clear description of the methods used to determine the parameter values, unless a person skilled in the art would know what method to use or unless all methods would yield the same result (see F‑IV, 4.11). If the disclosure is seriously insufficient, such a deficiency cannot be cured subsequently by adding further examples or features without offending against Art. 123(2), which requires that amendments may not result in the introduction of subject-matter which extends beyond the content of the application as filed (see H‑IV, 2.1; see also H‑V, 2.2). Therefore, in such circumstances, the application must normally be refused. If, however, the deficiency arises only in respect of some embodiments of the invention and not others, it could be remedied by restricting the claims to correspond to the sufficiently described embodiments only, the description of the remaining embodiments being deleted.

Art. 83 Art. 123(2)3. Insufficient disclosure

Occasionally applications are filed in which there is a fundamental insufficiency in the invention in the sense that it cannot be carried out by a person skilled in the art; there is then a failure to satisfy the requirements of Art. 83 which is essentially irreparable.

Two instances deserve special mention. The first is where the successful performance of the invention is dependent on chance. That is to say, the skilled person, in following the instructions for carrying out the invention, finds either that the alleged results of the invention are unrepeatable or that success in obtaining these results is achieved in a totally unreliable way. Sufficiency of disclosure cannot be acknowledged if the skilled person has to carry out a research programme based on trial and error to reproduce the results of the invention, with limited chances of success (T 38/11, Reasons 2.6). An example where this may arise is a microbiological process involving mutations. Such a case is to be distinguished from one where repeated success is assured even though accompanied by a proportion of failures, as can arise e.g. in the manufacture of small magnetic cores or electronic components. In this latter case, provided the satisfactory parts can be readily sorted by a non-destructive testing procedure, no objection arises under Art. 83. Another example can be found in the field of artificial intelligence if the mathematical methods and the training datasets are disclosed in insufficient detail to reproduce the technical effect over the whole range claimed. Such a lack of detail may result in a disclosure that is more like an invitation to a research programme (see also G‑II, 3.3.1).

The second instance is where successful performance of the invention is inherently impossible because it would be contrary to well-established physical laws – this applies e.g. to a perpetual motion machine. If the claims for such a machine are directed to its function, and not merely to its structure, an objection arises not only under Art. 83 but also under Art. 52(1) in that the invention is not "susceptible of industrial application" (see G‑III, 1).

Art. 834. Burden of proof as regards the possibility of performing and repeating the invention

Although the burden of proof in the framework of sufficiency of disclosure as a rule lies with the party raising the objection, this principle does not apply to cases where the application as filed does not provide a single example or other technical information from which it is plausible that the claimed invention can be carried out (see e.g. T 1329/11).

Furthermore, if there are serious doubts as regards the possibility of performing the invention and repeating it as described, the burden of proof as regards this possibility, or at least a demonstration that success is credible, rests with the applicant or the proprietor of the patent. In opposition, this may be the case where, for example, experiments carried out by the opponent suggest that the subject-matter of the patent does not achieve the desired technical result. As regards the possibility of performing and repeating the invention, see also F‑III, 3.5. Cases of partially insufficient disclosure

5.1 Only variants of the invention are incapable of being performed

5.2 Absence of well-known details

5.3 Difficulties in performing the invention5.1 Only variants of the invention are incapable of being performed

The fact that only variants of the invention, e.g. one of a number of embodiments of it, are not capable of being performed does not immediately give rise to the conclusion that the subject-matter of the invention as a whole is incapable of being performed, i.e. is incapable of resolving the problem involved and therefore of achieving the desired technical result.

Those parts of the description relating to the variants of the invention which are incapable of being performed and the relevant claims must, however, then be deleted or marked background information that is not part of the invention (see F‑IV, 4.3(iii)) at the request of the division if the deficiency is not remedied. The specification must then be so worded that the remaining claims are supported by the description and do not relate to embodiments which have proved to be incapable of being performed.

In some particular cases (for example claims relating to a combination of ranges or Markush claims), the scope of the claim might encompass a large number of alternatives, some of which correspond to non-working embodiments. In such cases, the presence of non-working embodiments in the claim is of no harm, provided that the specification contains sufficient information on the relevant criteria to identify the working embodiments within the claimed alternatives (G 1/03). See also G‑VII, 5.2.5.2 Absence of well-known details

For the purposes of sufficient disclosure the specification does not need to describe all the details of the operations to be carried out by the person skilled in the art on the basis of the instructions given, if these details are well-known and clear from the definition of the class of the claims or on the basis of common general knowledge (see also F‑III, 1 and F‑IV, 4.5).5.3 Difficulties in performing the invention

An invention is not immediately regarded as incapable of being performed on account of a reasonable degree of difficulty experienced in its performance ("teething troubles", for example).

1st example: The difficulties which could, for example, arise from the fact that an artificial hip joint could be fitted to the human body only by a surgeon of great experience and above-average ability would not prevent manufacturers of orthopaedic devices from deriving complete information from the description with the result that they could reproduce the invention with a view to making an artificial hip joint.

2nd example: A switchable semiconductor which, according to the invention, is used for switching electrical circuits on and off without using contacts, thereby making for smoother operation, suffers from teething troubles in that a residual current continues to flow in the circuit when switched off. However, this residual current adversely affects the use of the electrical switch in certain fields only, and can otherwise be reduced to negligible proportions by routine further development of the semiconductor.6. Inventions relating to biological material

6.1 Biological material

6.2 Public availability of biological material

6.3 Deposit of biological material

6.4 Priority claim

6.5 Euro-PCT cases6.1 Biological material

Applications relating to biological material are subject to the special provisions set out in Rule 31. In accordance with Rule 26(3), the term "biological material" means any material containing genetic information and capable of reproducing itself or being reproduced in a biological system. If an invention involves the use of or concerns biological material which is not available to the public and which cannot be described in the European patent application in such a manner as to enable the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art, the disclosure is not considered to have satisfied the requirements of Art. 83 unless the requirements of Rule 31(1), Rule 31(2), first and second sentences, and Rule 33(1), first sentence, have been met.

Rule 26(3) Rule 31(1)

For inventions based on biological material of plant or animal origin or using such material, it is recommended that the application, where appropriate, includes information on the geographical origin of such material, if known. However, this is without prejudice to the examination of European patent applications and European patents (EU Dir 98/44/EC, rec. 27).

Rule 26(1)6.2 Public availability of biological material

The division must form an opinion as to whether or not the biological material is available to the public. There are several possibilities. The biological material may be known to be readily available to those skilled in the art, e.g. baker's yeast or Bacillus natto, which is commercially available, it may be a standard preserved strain, or other biological material which the division knows to have been preserved in a recognised depositary institution and to be available to the public without restriction (see notice from the European Patent Office dated 7 July 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 498). Alternatively, the applicant may have given in the description sufficient information as to the identifying characteristics of the biological material and as to the prior availability to the public without restriction in a depositary institution recognised for the purposes of Rule 33(6) to satisfy the division (see the notice from the European Patent Office dated 7 July 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 498). In any of these cases no further action is called for. If, however, the applicant has given no or insufficient information on public availability and the biological material is a particular strain not falling within the known categories such as those already mentioned, then the division must assume that the biological material is not available to the public. It must also examine whether the biological material could be described in the European patent application in such a manner as to enable the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art (see, in particular, F‑III, 3 and G‑II, 5.5).6.3 Deposit of biological material

If the biological material is not available to the public and if it cannot be described in the application in such a manner as to enable the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art, the division must check:

(i)whether the application as filed gives such relevant information as is available to the applicant on the characteristics of the biological material. The relevant information under this provision concerns the classification of the biological material and significant differences from known biological material. For this purpose, the applicant must, to the extent available, indicate morphological and biochemical characteristics and the proposed taxonomic description.

The information on the biological material in question which is generally known to the skilled person on the date of filing is as a rule presumed to be available to the applicant, who must therefore provide it. If necessary, it has to be provided through experiments in accordance with the relevant standard literature.

For characterising bacteria, for example, the relevant standard work would be R.E. Buchanan, N.E. Gibbons: Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology.

Against this background, information needs to then be given on every further specific morphological or physiological characteristic relevant for recognition and propagation of the biological material, e.g. suitable media (composition of ingredients), in particular where the latter are modified.

Abbreviations for biological material or media are often less well known than the applicant assumes and are therefore to be avoided or written in full at least once.

If biological material is deposited that cannot replicate itself but must be replicated in a biological system (e.g. viruses, bacteriophages, plasmids, vectors or free DNA or RNA), the above-mentioned information is also required for such biological system. If, for example, other biological material is required, such as host cells or helper viruses, that cannot be sufficiently described or is not available to the public, this material must also be deposited and characterised accordingly. In addition, the process for producing the biological material within this biological system must be indicated.

In many cases the above required information will already have been given to the depositary institution (see Rule 6.1(a)(iii) BT and Rule 6.1(b) BT of the Regulation under the Budapest Treaty) and need only be incorporated into the application;

(ii)whether the name of the depositary institution and the accession number of the deposit were supplied at the date of filing. If the name of the depositary institution and the accession number of the deposit were submitted later, it is checked whether they were filed within the relevant period under Rule 31(2). If that is the case, it is then further checked whether on the filing date any reference was supplied which enables the deposit to be related to the later filed accession number. Normally the identification reference which the depositor gave to the deposit is used in the application documents. The relevant document for later filing the data pursuant to Rule 31(1)(c) could be a letter containing the name of the depositary institution, the accession number and the above-mentioned identification reference or, alternatively, the deposit receipt, which contains all these data (see also G 2/93 and A‑IV, 4.2); and

(iii)whether the deposit was made by a person other than the applicant and, if so, whether the name and the address of the depositor are stated in the application or were supplied within the relevant period under Rule 31(2). In such a case, the division must also check whether the document fulfilling the requirements mentioned in Rule 31(1)(d) was submitted to the EPO within the same time limit (see A‑IV, 4.1 for details of when this document referred to in Rule 31(1)(d) is required).

The division, in addition to the checks referred to under (i) to (iii) above, asks for the deposit receipt issued by the depositary institution (see Rule 7.1 BT of the Regulation under the Budapest Treaty) or for equivalent proof of the deposit of a biological material if such proof has not been filed before (see (ii) above and A‑IV, 4.2). This is to provide evidence for the indications made by the applicant pursuant to Rule 31(1)(c).

If this deposit receipt has already been filed within the relevant time period according to Rule 31(2), this document on its own is regarded as submission of the information according to Rule 31(1)(c).

Rule 31(1) and Rule 31(2)

In addition, the depositary institution named must be one of the recognised institutions listed in the Official Journal of the EPO. An up-to-date list is regularly published in the Official Journal.

Where a deposit was originally not made under the Budapest Treaty, it must be converted to a deposit made within the purview of the Budapest Treaty no later than the date of filing of the European patent application in order to fulfil the requirement of Rule 31(1)(a).

If any of these requirements is not satisfied, the biological material in question cannot be considered as having been disclosed pursuant to Art. 83 by way of reference to the deposit.

Rule 33(6)

Moreover, there are two situations in which the applicant can file information concerning the deposit which is required under Rule 31(1)(c), and where applicable also under Rule 31(1)(d), in a document filed after the accorded filing date and within the relevant time limit for filing that document, but after the expiry of one of the time limits under Rule 31(2)(a) to Rule 31(2)(c). As in the preceding paragraph, the consequence of the information being filed after the relevant time limit under Rule 31(2) is that the biological material is deemed not to have been disclosed pursuant to Art. 83 by way of reference to the deposit. These situations are those in which the information concerning the deposit is contained in either:

(a)a previously filed application to which reference is made under Rule 40(1)(c), the copy of that application being filed within either the two-month period under Rule 40(3) or that under Rule 55; or

(b)missing parts of the description filed later, within the two-month period under Rule 56(2), when the requirements of Rule 56(3) are satisfied, or correct application documents or parts filed later, within the two-month period under Rule 56a(3), when the requirements of Rule 56a(4) are satisfied, so that the application is not redated.

Rule 31 Rule 40(1)(c) Rule 56(2) and Rule 56(3) Rule 56a(3) and Rule 56a(4)6.4 Priority claim

An application may claim the priority of a previous application with regard to unavailable biological material mentioned in F‑III, 6.1. In this case, the invention is considered disclosed in the previous application for the purpose of the priority claim under Art. 87(1) only if the deposit of the biological material was made no later than the date of filing of the previous application and in accordance with the requirements of the country in which it was filed. Also, the reference to the deposit in the previous application must be made in a manner enabling it to be identified. Where the deposit of the biological material referred to in the European patent application is not the same as the deposit referred to in the priority, it is up to the applicant, if the EPO considers it necessary, to provide evidence that the biological material is identical (see also the notice from the EPO dated 7 July 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 498).6.5 Euro-PCT cases

International applications relating to the aforementioned unavailable biological material and designating or electing the EPO must comply with Rule 13bis PCT in conjunction with Rule 31. That means that for sufficient disclosure of the material the deposit with a recognised depositary institution must be made not later than the international filing date, relevant information must be given in the application and the necessary indications must be furnished as required during the international phase (see also the notice from the EPO dated 7 July 2010, OJ EPO 2010, 498).7. Proper names, trade marks and trade names

The use of proper names, trade marks or trade names or similar words to refer to materials or articles is undesirable in so far as such words merely denote origin or where they may relate to a range of different products. If such a word is used, then, where it is necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Art. 83, the product must be sufficiently identified, without reliance upon the word, to enable the invention to be carried out by the skilled person at the date of filing. However, where such words have become internationally accepted as standard descriptive terms and have acquired a precise meaning (e.g. "Bowden" cable, "Belleville" washer, "Panhard" rod, "caterpillar" belt) they may be allowed without further identification of the product to which they relate. For the assessment of the clarity of claims referring to a trade mark (Art. 84), see F‑IV, 4.8.8. Reference documents

References in European patent applications to other documents may relate either to the background art or to part of the disclosure of the invention.

Where the reference document relates to the background art, it may be in the application as originally filed or introduced at a later date (see F‑II, 4.3 and F-II, 4.4 and H‑IV, 2.2.7).

Where the reference document relates directly to the disclosure of the invention (e.g. details of one of the components of a claimed apparatus), then the examining division first considers whether knowing what is in the reference document is in fact essential for carrying out the invention as meant by Art. 83.

If not essential, the usual expression "which is hereby incorporated by reference", or any expression of the same kind, needs to be deleted from the description.

If matter in the document referred to is essential to satisfy the requirements of Art. 83, the examining division requires the deletion of the above-mentioned expression and that, instead, the matter is expressly incorporated into the description, because the patent specification must, regarding the essential features of the invention, be self-contained, i.e. capable of being understood without reference to any other document. Furthermore, documents are not part of the text to be translated pursuant to Art. 65 (T 276/99).

Such incorporation of essential matter or essential features is, however, subject to the restrictions set out in H‑IV, 2.2.1. It may be that the search division has requested the applicant to furnish the document referred to, in order to be able to carry out a meaningful search (see B‑IV, 1.3).

If, for the disclosure of the invention, a document is referred to in an application as originally filed, the relevant content of the reference document is to be considered as forming part of the content of the application for the purpose of citing the application under Art. 54(3) against later applications. For reference documents not available to the public before the filing date of the application this applies only if the conditions set out hereto in H‑IV, 2.2.1 are fulfilled.

Because of this effect under Art. 54(3), it is very important that, where a reference is directed only to a particular part of the document referred to, that part needs to be clearly identified in the reference.

Art. 659. "Reach-through" claims

In certain technical areas (e.g. biotechnology, pharmacy) cases occur where:

(i)one of the following and its use in a screening method have been defined as the only contribution to the art

– a polypeptide

– a protein

– a receptor

– an enzyme, etc., or

(ii)a new mechanism of action of such molecule has been defined.

It may happen that such applications contain so-called "reach-through" claims, i.e. claims directed to a chemical compound (or the use of that compound) defined only in functional terms with regard to the technical effect it exerts on one of the above molecules.

Typical examples of such claims would be: "An agonist/antagonist to polypeptide X [optionally as identified by the screening method of claim A]."; "An agonist/antagonist to polypeptide X [optionally as identified by the screening method of claim A], for use in therapy."; "An agonist/antagonist to polypeptide X [optionally as identified by the screening method of claim A], for use in the treatment of disease Y.", where the description indicates that polypeptide X is involved in disease Y.

According to Art. 83 and Rule 42(1)(c), the claim must contain sufficient technical disclosure of the solution to the problem. A functional definition of a chemical compound ("reach-through" claim) covers all compounds possessing the activity or effect specified in the claim. It would be an undue burden to isolate and characterise all potential compounds (e.g. agonists/antagonists), without any effective pointer to their identity (see F‑III, 1), or to test every known compound and every conceivable future compound for this activity to see if it falls within the scope of the claim. In effect, the applicant is attempting to patent what has not yet been invented, and the fact that the applicant can test for the effect used to define the compounds does not necessarily confer sufficiency on the claim; in fact it constitutes an invitation for the skilled person to perform a research programme (see T 435/91 (Reasons 2.2.1), followed by T 1063/06 (Headnote II)).

In general, claims directed to merely functionally defined chemical compounds that are to be found by means of a new kind of research tool (e.g. using a new screening method based on a newly discovered molecule or a new mechanism of action) are directed to future inventions, for which patent protection under the EPC is not designed. In the case of such "reach-through" claims, it is both reasonable and imperative to limit the subject-matter of the claims to the actual contribution to the art (see T 1063/06 (Headnote I)).10. Sufficiency of disclosure and Rules 56 and Rule 56a

Missing parts under Rule 56 and correct application documents or parts under Rule 56a may be withdrawn within one month of a notification on redating in order to maintain the original filing date, and these parts are then deemed to be no longer part of the application (see also A‑II, 5.4.2 and A-II, 5.5, A‑II, 6.5, C‑III, 1, H‑IV, 2.2.2 and H‑IV, 2.2.3).

Under Rule 56a(4), documents or parts filed erroneously cannot be withdrawn and may only be removed by amending the application in compliance with Art. 123(2).

In this case, the division must carefully evaluate whether the invention is still sufficiently disclosed without relying on the technical information contained in the withdrawn missing parts. If the division reaches the conclusion that the requirements of Art. 83 are not satisfied, a corresponding objection is raised. Ultimately, the application may be refused for lack of sufficient disclosure (see F‑III, 3 to F-III, 5).11. Sufficiency of disclosure and clarity

An ambiguity in the claims may lead to an insufficiency objection. However, ambiguity also relates to the scope of the claims, i.e. Art. 84 (see F‑IV, 4). Normally, therefore, an ambiguity in a claim will lead to an objection under Art. 83 only if the whole scope of the claim is affected, in the sense that it is impossible to carry out at all the invention defined therein. Otherwise an objection under Art. 84 is appropriate (see T 608/07, T 1811/13).

In particular (see T 593/09), where a claim contains an ill-defined ("unclear", "ambiguous") parameter (see also F‑IV, 4.11) and where, as a consequence, a person skilled in the art would not know whether they were working within or outside of the scope of the claim, this, by itself, is not a reason to deny sufficiency of disclosure as required by Art. 83. Nor is such a lack of clear definition necessarily a matter for objection under Art. 84 only. What is decisive for establishing insufficiency within the meaning of Art. 83 is whether the parameter, in the specific case, is so ill-defined that a person skilled in the art is not able, on the basis of the disclosure as a whole and using common general knowledge, to identify (without undue burden) the technical measures necessary to solve the problem underlying the application at issue, e.g. see T 61/14.

There is a delicate balance between Art. 83 and Art. 84, which has to be assessed on the merits of each individual case. Care has therefore to be taken in opposition that an insufficiency objection is not merely a hidden objection under Art. 84, especially in the case of ambiguities in the claims (T 608/07). On the other hand, even though lack of support/clarity is not a ground for opposition (see also F‑IV, 6.4), a problem related to it may in fact be of concern under Art. 83.12. Sufficiency of disclosure and inventive step

If the claimed invention lacks reproducibility, this may become relevant under the requirements of sufficiency of disclosure or inventive step. The technical effect achieved by the invention solves the problem which underlies the application. If an invention lacks reproducibility because its desired technical effect as expressed in the claim is not achieved, this results in a lack of sufficient disclosure, which has to be objected to under Art. 83. Otherwise, i.e. if the effect is not expressed in the claim but is part of the problem to be solved, there is a problem of inventive step (see G 1/03, Reasons 2.5.2, T 1079/08, T 1319/10, T 5/06 and T 380/05).

See F‑III, 3 for cases where successful performance of the invention is inherently impossible because it would be contrary to the well-established laws of physics.Chapter IV – Claims (Art. 84 and formal requirements)

Annex – Examples concerning essential features1. General

The application must contain "one or more claims".

Art. 78(1)(c)

These must:

(i)"define the matter for which protection is sought";

(ii)"be clear and concise"; and

(iii)"be supported by the description".

Art. 84

Since the extent of the protection conferred by a European patent or application is determined by the claims (interpreted with the help of the description and the drawings), clarity of the claims is of the utmost importance (see also F‑IV, 4).

Art. 69(1)2. Form and content of claims

2.1 Technical features

2.2 Two-part form

2.3 Two-part form unsuitable

2.4 Formulae and tables2.1 Technical features

The claims must be drafted in terms of the "technical features of the invention". This means that claims must not contain any statements relating, for example, to commercial advantages or other matters not related to "carrying out" the invention, but statements of purpose are allowed if they assist in defining the invention.

It is not necessary that every feature is expressed in terms of a structural limitation. Functional features may be included provided that a skilled person would have no difficulty in providing some means of performing this function without exercising inventive skill (see F‑IV, 6.5). For the specific case of a functional definition of a pathological condition, see F‑IV, 4.21.

Claims to the use of the invention, in the sense of the technical application thereof, are allowable.

Rule 43(1)2.2 Two-part form

Rule 43(1)(a) and Rule 43(1)(b) define the two-part form which a claim must have "wherever appropriate".

The first part or "preamble" needs to contain a statement indicating "the designation of the subject-matter of the invention", i.e. the general technical class of apparatus, process, etc. to which the invention relates, followed by a statement of "those technical features which are necessary for the definition of the claimed subject-matter but which, in combination, are part of the prior art". This requirement to state prior-art features in the first part of the claim is applicable only to independent claims and not to dependent claims (see F‑IV, 3.4). It is clear from the wording of Rule 43 that it is necessary only to refer to those prior-art features which are relevant to the invention. For example, if the invention relates to a photographic camera but the inventive step relates entirely to the shutter, it would be sufficient for the first part of the claim to read: "A photographic camera including a focal plane shutter" and there is no need to refer also to the other known features of a camera such as the lens and view-finder.

The second part or "characterising portion" needs to state the features which the invention adds to the prior art, i.e. the technical features for which, in combination with the features stated in the first part, protection is sought.

If a single document in the state of the art according to Art. 54(2), e.g. cited in the search report, reveals that one or more features in the second part of the claim were already known in combination with all the features in the first part of the claim and in that combination have the same effect as they have in the full combination according to the invention, the division will require that such feature or features be transferred to the first part.

Where, however, a claim relates to a novel combination, and where the division of the features of the claim between the preamble and the characterising part could be made in more than one way without inaccuracy, applicants must not be pressed, unless there are very substantial reasons, to adopt a different division of the features from that which they have chosen, if their version is not incorrect. If the applicant insists on including more features in the preamble than can be derived from the closest available prior art, this is accepted.

If no other prior art is available, this first part of the claim could be used to raise an objection on the ground of lack of inventive step (see G‑VII, 5.1, last paragraph).

Rule 43(1)2.3 Two-part form unsuitable

Subject to what is stated in F‑IV, 2.3.2, final sentence, applicants are required to follow the above two-part formulation in their independent claim or claims, where, for example, it is clear that their invention resides in a distinct improvement in an old combination of parts or steps. However, as is indicated by Rule 43, this form need be used only in appropriate cases. The nature of the invention may be such that this form of claim is unsuitable, e.g. because it would give a distorted or misleading picture of the invention or the prior art. Examples of the kind of invention which may require a different presentation are:

(i)the combination of known integers of equal status, the inventive step lying solely in the combination;

(ii)the modification of, as distinct from addition to, a known chemical process e.g. by omitting one substance or substituting one substance for another; and

(iii)a complex system of functionally interrelated parts, the inventive step concerning changes in several of these or in their interrelationships.

In examples (i) and (ii), the Rule 43 form of claim may be artificial and inappropriate, whilst in example (iii) it might lead to an inordinately lengthy and involved claim. Another example in which the Rule 43 form of claim may be inappropriate is where the invention is a new chemical compound or group of compounds. It is likely also that other cases will arise in which the applicant is able to adduce convincing reasons for formulating the claim in a different form.
